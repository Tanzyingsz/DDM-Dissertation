### The importance of storytelling in a website

#### What can storytelling do?

Storytelling paves the way to get insight into users and build emotional connections with them.

Scientifically, neuroscience backs up the need for stories. When people listening to stories, multiple regions of their brain activated. That is the reason why people can still retell a story even if they haven’t read it for 30 years. Also, “psychological research shows we have higher comprehension of the material in story form than the same information presented without being in a story.”(medium) (Source)

### UX(User experience)

##### What is interaction design

By definition, the word “interaction” means “an occasion when two or more people or things communicate with or react to each other”(INTERACTION | meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary, 2020). When it comes to the concept of a website, the designer is actually creating a conversation and building a relationship between the platform and its customers through interaction(Nichols, 2017). It is crucial to make this “conversation” as natural as possible.

When a user comes across a good interaction system, it should be like “... interactions with a polite, considerate human. ” (Cooper, Reimann and Cronin, 2007)The reason behind is buried in the human instinct - if an object performs a certain level of interactivity, the instinct of behaving like another sentient being is activated. (Reeves and Nass, 1996) Thus people are able to build emotional connections with websites embedded fine interactions.

#### Motion, the salt of interaction design.

A cohesive motion system can improve the user experience by reflecting the brand personality, providing clearer feedbacks and producing an immersive environment. (Goyeneche, 2020)

As for branding, the transition between different pages and state-change can be either playful or subtle. They represent two different kinds of brand personalities - cheerful or calm.

In the scenarios where the user has to wait for feedback when submitting forms or waiting for loading, animations could provide the status of the system through visualized bar or numbers. In some cases, interactive animations even help to break complicated information down. For example, the Apple Card informs users the charges range through the circular animation. Compared to a long paragraph of description, the animation express the process more Intuitively. These meaningful details are like the tiny hopes within websites. They tell the user “something is going to happen”, ease the user anxiety, help them to avoid common mistakes and keep them from leaving.

_TBC: effects on emotion and environment_

Of course, even though moving elements are a powerful tool to attract user attention, they must be “unobtrusive, brief, and subtle” (Laubheimer, 2020). The usage of motions should be restricted only to the necessary areas. Just like salt: overuse them will ruin the flavour; leave them out will leave recipe tastes bland.

#### Why interaction design is important in user experience?

As pointed out in “Don’t make me think!” (Krug, 2006), user tend to “scan” the web pages instead of reading words by words and only stop by the fraction that interests them. Therefore catching user attention with … become extremely important.

#### How interaction design helps to improve storytelling

### UI(User interface)

#### Colour

The theme colour should fit the user persona and emotion the website portrays.

#### Buttons

By adding arrows or graphics to CTA(Call-To-Act) buttons, the click-through-rate increases(Kapoor, 2018).

#### Accessibility

FONT SIZE
In 2019, over 2.2 billion people worldwide are suffering from vision impairment or blindness (Vision impairment and blindness, 2019). In the UK alone, one in five people reported a disability(Family Resources Survey 2018/19, 2020). Increasing the accessibility should be top of mind when designing the user experience, not only for the good of the disabled individuals but for the general public. An accessible web app will save the pain in dealing with future lawsuits as well.

Although making the website 100% accessible is not possible within the limited amount of time, there are some approaches that can improve overall accessibility. WCAG 2.0 Guidelines provides four principles for the website to follow: perceivable, operable, understandable and robust(Caldwell et al, 2018).
