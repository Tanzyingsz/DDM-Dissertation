#### WEBSITE ANALYSIS

_分析别人的网站里面故事是怎么讲的_
_有哪些元素让这些故事更生动: interactive story 有什么形式，它们有什么好处，什么坏处_
10 educational websites that express brand stories well are being analysised first. The focus of this stage is to dig out the advantage and disadvantage they have in common.

Intstructive animations exists in 90% of the websites. Although the concept of multimedia is becoming more famous these days, videos and images are not necessarily the compulsory part of every website. Only 2 websites embedded them all, while the rest goes for one of the two media or simply use illustrations to depict its content. Loading aniamtion is another component that is commonly used (8 of 10). Almost all (9 of 10) websites used parallax effect in their pages, whether subtle or obvious. The paragrah and illustrations on several layers whose moving rate follows the rule or "the nearer the faster", create a sense of depth of the virtual environment. Even though the visual effect has been attached much attention, the sound effect is less concerned.

Of the 10 websites surveyed, ?% did not have a clear call to action instruction at the beginning.
During the period of this study,

#### SURVEY

Then these websites are further analysised by 12 anonymous Chinese students. The goal is to find out what components the modern Chinese students care about most.

Gereally, the website with interaction more than just scrolling manipulation earns a better reputation than those pure scrolling experience.

There are some details that needs to be noticed: 3 out of 12 mentioned their "CPU burned and the page get laggy" when browing some of the websites heavy in animation. The overall performance of the website should be taken into consideration. In order to ease the burden of loading, the design components should be as lightweight as possible. For example, produce more .SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) files instead of .png or .jpg files. SVG format is responsive but smaller in file size. Because scaling SVG images on different screen won't affect their resolution and they eliminates the time-consuming HTTP request that is usually used to fetch image files (Benefits of using SVG, 2017).

### The importance of interactive storytelling

Storytelling paves the way to get insight into users and build emotional connections with them.

Scientifically, neuroscience backs up the need for stories. When people listening to stories, multiple regions of their brain activated. That is the reason why people can still retell a story even if they haven’t read it for years. Also, “psychological research shows we have higher comprehension of the material in story form than the same information presented without being in a story.”(medium) (Source)

As for the marketing part, a good story will not only engage users, but also give them the impluse to spread the story with friends.

Catch user attention

Telling story online can pose more impact on users. It is said that people are 22 times more likely to memorize a fact when they are presented in the form of a story.(Olson,2014) Through the multipe media,ranging from visuals, animations and clickable interactive components that embedded in website,multiple regions of brain are activated.

Moreover, human brain processes visual information 60% faster than the written ones. A viusual symbol only costs 250 milliseconds to analysis and understand. In terms of the story content, almost 7 out of 10 insists that the "educational" content is the most valuabe.

### DESIGN BRIEF

#### UX(User experience)

##### What is interaction design

By definition, the word “interaction” means “an occasion when two or more people or things communicate with or react to each other”(INTERACTION | meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary, 2020). When it comes to the concept of a website, the designer is actually creating a conversation and building a relationship between the platform and its customers through interaction(Nichols, 2017). It is crucial to make this “conversation” as natural as possible.

When a user comes across a good interaction system, it should be like “... interactions with a polite, considerate human. ” (Cooper, Reimann and Cronin, 2007)The reason behind is buried in the human instinct - if an object performs a certain level of interactivity, the instinct of behaving like another sentient being is activated. (Reeves and Nass, 1996) Thus people are able to build emotional connections with websites embedded fine interactions.

Therefore, tell the story in an interactive way is more efficient than static.

##### Motion, the salt of interaction design.

A cohesive motion system can improve the user experience by reflecting the brand personality, providing clearer feedbacks and producing an immersive environment. (Goyeneche, 2020)

As for branding, the transition between different pages and state-change can be either playful or subtle. They represent two different kinds of brand personalities - cheerful or calm.

In the scenarios where the user has to wait for feedback when submitting forms or waiting for loading, animations could provide the status of the system through visualized bar or numbers. In some cases, interactive animations even help to break complicated information down. For example, the Apple Card informs users the charges range through the circular animation. Compared to a long paragraph of description, the animation express the process more Intuitively. These meaningful details are like the tiny hopes within websites. They tell the user “something is going to happen”, ease the user anxiety, help them to avoid common mistakes and keep them from leaving.

_TBC: effects on emotion and environment_

Of course, even though moving elements are a powerful tool to attract user attention, they must be “unobtrusive, brief, and subtle” (Laubheimer, 2020). The usage of motions should be restricted only to the necessary areas. Just like salt: overuse them will ruin the flavour; leave them out will leave recipe tastes bland.

#### Why interaction design is important in user experience?

As pointed out in “Don’t make me think!” (Krug, 2006), user tend to “scan” the web pages instead of reading words by words and only stop by the fraction that interests them. Therefore catching user attention with … become extremely important.

#### UI(User interface)

##### Colour

The theme colour should fit the user persona and emotion the website portrays.

##### Buttons

By adding arrows or graphics to CTA(Call-To-Act) buttons, the click-through-rate increases(Kapoor, 2018).

###### Accessibility

**FONT SIZE**
In 2019, over 2.2 billion people worldwide are suffering from vision impairment or blindness (Vision impairment and blindness, 2019). In the UK alone, one in five people reported a disability(Family Resources Survey 2018/19, 2020). Increasing the accessibility should be top of mind when designing the user experience, not only for the good of the disabled individuals but for the general public. An accessible web app will save the pain in dealing with future lawsuits as well.

Although making the website 100% accessible is not possible within the limited amount of time, there are some approaches that can improve overall accessibility. WCAG 2.0 Guidelines provides four principles for the website to follow: perceivable, operable, understandable and robust(Caldwell et al, 2018).
