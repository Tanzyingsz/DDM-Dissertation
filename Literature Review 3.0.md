# Literature Review

## 1 User experience

1.

## 2 Storytelling

## 2.1 What is storytelling?

The voice of the public support the importance of storytelling. In an 2017 report, storytelling was rated the most effective marketing tatics among 62% of B2B marketers. The number of B2C storytelling supporter was even higher (The Science of Storytelling (Infographic), 2017).

Telling story online can pose more impact on users. It is said that people are 22 times more likely to memorize a fact when they are presented in the form of a story.(Olson,2014) Through the multipe media,ranging from visuals, animations and clickable interactive components that embedded in website,multiple regions of brain are activated.

The trick in storytelling is instead of showing the whole picture at the beginning, let the reader figure out the story on their own. As Andrew Stanton,the world-famous film director once said in TED: "Don't give them 4, give them 2+2."

Combine data and stories together, a brand will be able to touch its audience both intellectually and emotionnally.

## 2.3 Interactive storytelling

## 3. RE: source Project Brief

The number of online second-hand shopper increased exponentially worldwide in recent years. It is said that online second-hand markets had already become a crucial part of the circular economy (Hamari et al., 2016). The reason for setting up this sustainable project is to test out which web design attributes are best for instilling trust in online sustainable brands.

**THE PROJECT**
RE: source is a second-hand, sustainability-driven online marketplace serving sellers, outbound Chinese students and buyers, inbound Chinese students who are starting their education in the UK.

The sustainable component is adopted as a supporting marketing strategy. Previous case shows the "sustainable" movement potentially brings benefits. In 2013, IKEA Norway held a temporary online flea market collecting and reselling the used IKEA items. At the end of the 8-week-long campaign, IKEA announced the increase in furniture sale(Rudenko, 2013). In conclusion, the sustainalbe tag can actually have positive effect to a brand. It also pass the message of being responsible and caring for envirnoment. "Protect the environment" is also listed in the top 10 motivators that significantly affects customer value(Harvard Business Review,2015).

> **THE OFFERING**
> According to the brief questionnaire among 75 Chinese second-hand buyers, WeChat, the largest social media in China, turns out to be the No.1 channel Chinese students use for idle goods transaction. As a messaging app, WeChat provides a clunky, unorganised, and an uninformative shopping experience that requires users to tediously scroll through the group’s chat history, not knowing whether they will ﬁnd their desired item or whether the item is available. For the rest of mentioned platforms, users complain a lot about "the low quality of products, being scammed and the lake of customer service" (https://uk.trustpilot.com/).

As a business-to-consumer(B2C) second-hand e-commerce platform, RE: source will provide a better second-hand donating and shopping experience than its competitors. First of all, the process of reserving doorstep donation collection service will be simplified through the design of form. Then the crew will clean and check the donated items to ensure the quality. As the brand is the one that distributes the product, there is no fear of scamming any more. Next, the website will optimize the shopping experience based on the five design attributes mentioned above. To raise user trust, the brand also provides timely advisory service through live chatting box and Wechat. Of course, the traditional email communication will also be available in the page.

**THE TARGET USERS**

**THE VALUE**
First of all, the project helps to save natural resource and prevent unnecessary pollution through selling second hand product to those in need. The value of used items are maximized in a new life. Secondly, as for the usage of fundings, apart from supporting the compulsory deliery and storage service, RE: source plan to use the profit to fund the artist who can upcycle the second hand goods through redesign in the future. Moreover, to deliver sustainable ideas to a larger audience, the brand also provide workshop which invites the public to participate in the redesign process.
