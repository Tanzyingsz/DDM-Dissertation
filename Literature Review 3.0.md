- The case of RE: source the sustainable B2C second hand platform

# Introduction

The following research questions are formulated:

1. What is a good user experience?
2. What is an online interactive storytelling?
3. How to optimize the user experience in a e-commerce brand with online interavtive storytelling?

# Literature Review

## 1. User Experience

## 1.1 User Experience Design

The core of an user experience is the user need. The second important criteria is the product or service has to bring joy and delight to the user(Norman and Nielsen, 2020).

Under the heading of user experience design, the main goal of a system it to imporve its usefulness.(Norman and Nielsen, 2020). Usefulness is made up of two parts: usability, how easy it is to interact with the user interface, and utility, whether the system is functional enough with all the feature user need. The two sides supplement each other. A wonderful user interface with none of the needed function will be abandoned while a funtcional website with poor interface that confuses user will disappoint its users.

## 1.2 Aarron Walter's Hierarchy of User Needs

Based on the famous Abraham Maslow's theory (Maslow and Lewis, 1987) which indicates an unidirectional linear relationship between the basic human needs and a higher level of motivation, Aarron Walter proposed a mirror hierarchy of user needs focus in the area of interface. In this version of user needs pyramid, after the fullfillment of foundamental needs including functionality, realiability and usability comes the most superior needs, pleasure.

In other words, for the basic level, no matter how aesthetically perfect an application is, it will not appreciated by users becasue its lack in function. The reason why functionality matters is that, according to negativity bias, user affected by the bad more than the good. (Ito et al., 1998) That is to say, a single function flaw will ruin impression formed by many positive features. On the next level, if a fully functional interface acts unreliable, for example, breaking down all the time or does not provide trustworthy safety protection, it can hardly satisfy the target user. Moveing upwards, an interface have to be easy to understand and navigate with to be usable. Finally, the delightful interface features can be pursued. Specifically, animations, proper interactivity, well-presented microcontent like short and powerful titles, summaries, hints and tips that embed the characteristics of a brand(Loranger and Nielsen,2017), all contribute to delight.

RE: source is designed to achieve delight. The ideal performance reqires to meet the Aaron's user needs.

(1) Functional: RE: source helps donators to fill in the form as quick and easy as possible and provides the buyer the list and filter for second-hand products.

(3) Reliable: RE: source responds consistently and is effective in finding the desired stuff and helping user finish the tasks.

(2) Usable: The web app contains enough brief status information of products and clear instructions. Advanced information only shown when needed to reduce distractions. The pages work seamlessly.

(4) Pleasurable: RE: source embed clean and aesthetic illustrations, subtle animations, adequate amount of tiny gamified elements and gives timely encouraging feedback to reassure user knows what is going on.

## 2 Storytelling

## 2.1 Storytelling Overview

Story contains series of information that makes up plots. A commonly seen story generally works like this: a character encounter some problem before he can reach his goal. At the moment of despair, a guide appears with a thorough plan, encourage him to take action, and finally help him get through multiple failures and achieved sucess(Miller, 2017).

The voice of the public support the importance of storytelling. In a 2017 report, storytelling was rated the most effective marketing tatics among 62% of B2B marketers. The number of B2C storytelling supporter was even higher (The Science of Storytelling (Infographic), 2017).It is said that people are 22 times more likely to memorize a fact when they are presented in the form of a story (Ochs and Capps, 2009). Science backup the crucial role of storytelling - human brain is hardwired for stories. Zak's research (2013) discovered story will increase the release of neurochemical oxytocin, the so-called "love hormone". As a result, listener to the story will perform a higher level of empathy and connection to a brand.

## 2.2 Storytelling In Brand

In the modern world, the information explosion feed people with way too much noise. Storytelling is a powerful approach to create music out of noise (Miller, 2017). A well-choreographed music piece act like a map that lead the customer all the way through the product and services provided. In this case, customer do not have to waste extra calories of their overloaded mind and can make a connection with a brand easily.

Not any random story will work as a persuasive brand story. Instead of talking merely about the brand itself, tell the story about customer makes the customer care more (Miller, 2017). While Braging about the quality of product or service is not the goal of a brand story, Establishing a stronger relationship between the brand and customer definately is.

Some framework helps to strucutre a story that provide a better user experience, previous study proposed frameworks like the persona-based model (Herskovitz, and Crystal,2010),the Hero’s Journey story framwork (Campbell, 2008), storyBrand 7-Part framework (SB7 framework)(Miller, 2017) etc. Among which Miller's framework is the most comprehensive and easy to process for customers. Therefore this project plan to adapt Miller's work into practice. The SB7 framework propose a 7-plot-points genuine story formula: (1) _A character_, specially refers to a hero acted by the customer (2) _A poblem to solve_. If the character stays in forever peace, the story cannot move on. Therefore a villain -(?)- In order to find out the villain of the story, three levels of problems, namely external, interanal and philosophical are discussed here. (3) _A guide_. The one who helps the hero to conqure all promblems and win - the brand itself. (4) _A plan_ that takes away consumer's confusion. (5) _Call to action_, challenge the character to take actual step that brings them from challenge back to a peaceful life. (6) _A tragic ending_ that warns the customer what might happen if they do not follow the lead of this brand. (7) _The glorious success_, illustrate the bright future of following the lead of this brand.

When put into practice, the RE:souce project adopted the mentioned framework like this:

_For donator:_
Slogan: "Help the environmentalists to donte within 3 minutes. Save your time for something else you enjoy (subtitle)."

The external problem of donator is to deal with a large amount of second hand load within a limited time. The internal problem is the reluctance to resolve procrastination when facing hard-work with no rewards as well as the conflict of being a caring environmentalists or
Therefore the character or conversation in the page will explain the idea "we hate taking heavy furnitures downstairs and dump them as much as you do."

_For buyer:_
"Best bargain on the reliable used items in town. Your friend will be jealous."

Problem: scard to be scammed.
To ease customer's doubt, RE: source have an agreement plan with customers that every goods

"We know a bus trip to IKEA with tons of household items back is a hassal. Why not enjoy the bargain online? All stuff here are still good as new and directly delivered to your doorstep. "

## 2.3 Interactive Storytelling

Storytelling itself is interactive by defination - in the words of National Storytelling Network (2020): "...storytelling emerges from the interaction and cooperative, coordinated efforts of teller and audience." Therefore storytelling is always a bidirectional communication.

Telling story online can pose more impact on users. Through the multipe media,ranging from visuals, animations and clickable interactive components that embedded in website,multiple regions of brain are activated.

The trick in storytelling is instead of showing the whole picture at the beginning, let the reader figure out the story on their own. As Andrew Stanton (2012), the world-famous film director once said in his TED: "Don't give them (the audience) 4, give them 2+2."

By Combining data and stories together, a brand will be able to touch its audience emotionnally. Research have proved that emotionally connected customers are 52% more valuable than its higly satisfied counterparts, on average (Harvard Business Review,2015). The emotionally bond customers are less sensitive to price but more willing to revisit a brand and buy products. Data in story can help setting up the environment. For example, in a compaign that persuade people the importance of sustainbility, the data of how severve the environment has been damaged can give the audience an overview of the situation.

## 3. RE: source Project Brief

The segment of online shopping, in particular, online second-hand shopping had been grown the fastest worldwide in recent years (Fernando et al., 2016).It is also said that online second-hand markets had already become a crucial part of the circular economy (Hamari et al., 2016). The reason for setting up this sustainable project is to ...

**THE PROJECT**
RE: source is a second-hand, sustainability-driven online marketplace serving sellers, outbound Chinese students and buyers, inbound Chinese students who are starting their education in the UK.

The sustainable component is adopted as a supporting marketing strategy. Previous case shows the "sustainable" movement potentially brings benefits. In 2013, IKEA Norway held a temporary online flea market collecting and reselling the used IKEA items. At the end of the 8-week-long campaign, IKEA announced the increase in furniture sale(Rudenko, 2013). In conclusion, the sustainalbe tag can actually have positive effect to a brand. It also pass the message of being responsible and caring for envirnoment. "Protect the environment" is also listed in the top 10 motivators that significantly affects customer value(Harvard Business Review,2015).

**THE OFFERING**

According to the brief questionnaire among 75 Chinese second-hand buyers, WeChat, the largest social media in China, turns out to be the No.1 channel Chinese students use for idle goods transaction. As a messaging app, WeChat provides a clunky, unorganised, and an uninformative shopping experience that requires users to tediously scroll through the group’s chat history, not knowing whether they will ﬁnd their desired item or whether the item is available. Ebay and Gumtree are also mentioned as commonly used second-hand web applications. According to online feebacks, These two platforms got many complains about "the low quality of products, being scammed and the lake of customer service" (https://uk.trustpilot.com/). To find out more painpoints, another research target at previous Ebay and Gumtree users were carried out. _Research result goes here_

As a business-to-consumer(B2C) second-hand e-commerce platform, RE: source will provide a better second-hand donating and shopping experience than its competitors. First of all, the process of reserving doorstep donation collection service will be simplified through the design of form. Then the crew will clean and check the donated items to ensure the quality. As the brand is the one that distributes the product, there is no fear of scamming any more. Next, the website will optimize the shopping experience based on the five design attributes mentioned above. To raise user trust, the brand also provides timely advisory service through live chatting box and Wechat. Of course, the traditional email communication will also be available in the page.

**THE TARGET USERS**

**THE VALUE**
First of all, the project helps to save natural resource and prevent unnecessary pollution through selling second hand product to those in need. The value of used items are maximized in a new life. Secondly, as for the usage of fundings, apart from supporting the compulsory deliery and storage service, RE: source plan to use the profit to fund the artist who can upcycle the second hand goods through redesign in the future. Moreover, to deliver sustainable ideas to a larger audience, the brand also provide workshop which invites the public to participate in the redesign process.

# Question

- The plan for the Ebay and Gumtree questionnaire is (1)Ask the user to briefly described the most impressive experience they had on the platform. (2) What are the most satisfying parts of your experience using this website? e.g. Was the website easy to navigate? (3)What are the disappointing or annoying part of using this website? e.g. Can you find the desired product easily? Was the delivery and commonly asked question page useful etc.?

# Backup

# Conversational Storytelling

Conversational storytelling referes to a nonlinear, highly-visual, and narrative-based approach of presenting content. Escape from the traditional "momonologue" storytelling model, the conversation floating between two or more entities leads to a more immersive experience.
