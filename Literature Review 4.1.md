## 2.1. User Experience

### 2.1.1 User Experience Design

The core of user experience is the user need. The second important criteria are the product or service has to bring joy and delight to the user (Norman and Nielsen, 2020).

Under the heading of user experience design, the main goal of a system is to improve its usefulness. (Norman and Nielsen, 2020). Usefulness is made up of two parts: usability, how easy it is to interact with the user interface, and utility, whether the system is functional enough with all the feature user need. The two sides supplement each other. A wonderful user interface with none of the needed function will be abandoned while a functional website with a poor interface that confuses user will disappoint its users.

### 2.1.2 Aarron Walter's Hierarchy of User Needs

Based on the Abraham Maslow's theory (Maslow and Lewis, 1987) which indicates a unidirectional linear relationship between the basic human needs and a higher level of motivation, Aarron Walter proposed a mirror hierarchy of user needs focus in the area of the interface. In this version of user needs pyramid, after the fulfilment of fundamental needs including functionality, reliability and usability comes the most superior needs, pleasure.

[Figure: Aarron Walter’s Hierarchy of User Needs]

In other words, for the basic level, no matter how aesthetically perfect an application is, it will not be appreciated by users because of its lack in function. The reason why functionality matters is that, according to negativity bias, the user affected by the bad more than the good. (Ito et al, 1998) That is to say, a single function flaw will ruin the impression formed by many positive features. On the next level, if a fully functional interface acts unreliable, for example, breaking down all the time or does not provide trustworthy safety protection, it can hardly satisfy the target user. Moving upwards, an interface have to be easy to understand and navigate to be usable. Finally, the delightful interface features can be pursued. Specifically, animations, proper interactivity, well-presented microcontent like short and powerful titles, summaries, hints and tips that embed the characteristics of a brand(Loranger and Nielsen,2017), all contribute to delight.

### 2.1.3 Usability and user interface

_content_
_Typography_
Typography act as a core building block for a brand. After all, whenever a brand tries to convey a message or interface with customers through textual form, they have to rely on the support of typographic design. A proper text treatment will measurably affect user productivity and increase satisfaction in user experience.

Typography mainly servers two functions: establish the character of a brand and provide typographical hierarchy (Boulton, 2009). The features of a typeface reflect the intent of a brand. The whitespace in between letters, the various stress and weight all contribute to the changing "feeling" of a brand. Generally, the typographical hierarchy is dealing with contrast. It highlights the content that matters to the user most. Designers commonly create contrast between headings and body text through the adjustment of font size, weight and typeface. Since contrast contains the meaning of "difference", it is crucial to set distinct roles to fonts and their variants. And the role should be consistent within a website for a united brand feeling.

Based on the above discussion, Re: source adopted two typefaces: Merriweather and Helvetica Neue as its type scale. These two fonts are distinct from each other in design yet does not conflict. Merriweather is a serif font which is designed to be "pleasant to read on screens"(Google Fonts, 2020). Besides the slight offset of numbers in font produce a cheerful mood. Therefore RE: source use it as a body and price tag typeface. Helvetica Neue belongs to the most widely used sans serif font face family, Helvetica. Compared to its relatives, Helvetica Neue has a more unified set of heights and widths and abundant variants. The most copy within RE:source website is set to Helvetica Neue. Together, these two fonts form a harmonious combination.

Moreover, considering the different interpretation of font size on a different system, like Mac OS and Windows systems, and browsers, RE:source website use scalable measurement "em" in CSS to define font size.

_Color_

Overall, colour contributes to the user interface in three dimensions: pass information through visual hierarchy, arouse emotional responses from users and shape the brand image.

Firstly, as the basic component of the physical world, colour provides humankind with an incredible amount of information. Studies shows that when interacting with a brand, people carry out approximately 62‐90 per cent of their snap assessment based on colours alone(Singh,2016). To communicate the information clearly, one can use colour to build an visual hierarchy. Visual hierarchy can show help the user to understand website structure eaiser and guide user attention. Once user get to focus the main message sent by a brand, they are one step closer to build a short-term memory on the experience, then end up in a higher comprehension towards the brand. The core of visual hierarchy development is not aesthetic but functional. Salience, the description of how noticeable something is, act as a key in visual hierarchy(Brian, 2019). By experimenting with saturation, shade and tint of different hue, the priority of elements can be adjusted accordingly. Nevertheless, some colour naturally perform more salient than their counterparts(Camgöz, 2000). According to the following figure, blue-green undoubtedly dominates others.

https://www.alterspark.com/wp-content/uploads/visual-salience.png
(Figure: Visual salience of colors)

Secondly, many studies have proved that colour has an effect on emotions states(Singh,2016; Kumar, 2017), both positive and negative. If the website is full of eye glaring colours, or colour without enough contrast, the user might generate feelings of irritation(Lim & Ting, 2012). Vice versa, a harmonious colour scheme that fits genetic psychology will please the public.

ttps://www.alterspark.com/wp-content/uploads/emotion-hue-wavelength.png
(Figure: Hue in wavelength)

The visual colour map indicate that pleasue and control emotions peek in the blue zone. Blue is also said to be associated with key word safety and comfort.(Brian, 2019)

Thirdly, colour helps to communicate brand image since it represents the personality of a brand(Kumar, 2017).For instances, when people see a rectangle yellow border, they will immediately recognize it as the "frame" sign for National Geographic. Therefore, carefully pick the colour and make it fits the genre of the brand is necessary.As Seo (2010) pointed out, the colour green in a sustainable brand gets more positive responsive on environmental messages, RE:source used green as the brand logo colour.

In order to show the various status of information and express a clear hierarchy, RE:source picked the colour theme with one primary colour, blue, and five additional colours. Inspired by the visual salience chart above, green and orange are used as the secondary and third level of colour in priority. The overall elaborate colour theme helps RE:source to present readable and understandable content, pass the brand value of safe and reliable.

However, It is worth mentioning that the effects of colour have an individual difference. Accordingly, website design has to take accessibility into consideration for the user with colour deficiency or other visual impairment (Lányi, 2017). One of the most efficient solutions is to avoid colour-only information. Use other elements like word description or pattern to enforce the message as well.

_Motion Design_
A cohesive motion system can improve the user experience by reflecting the brand personality, providing clearer feedbacks and producing an immersive environment. (Goyeneche, 2020)

As for branding, the transition between different pages and state-change can be either playful or subtle. They represent two different kinds of brand personalities - cheerful or calm.

In the scenarios where the user has to wait for feedback when submitting forms or waiting for loading, animations could provide the status of the system through visualized bar, numbers or focus area. In some cases, interactive animations even help to break complicated information down. Compared to static image, a sequence of animation increase the content capacity and reduce the effort to understand information. For example, the Apple Card informs users the charges range through the circular animation. Compared to a long paragraph of description, the animation expresses the process more Intuitively. These meaningful details are like the tiny hopes within websites. They tell the user “something is going to happen”, ease the user anxiety, help them to avoid common mistakes and keep them from leaving.

**Immersive environment**

Of course, even though moving elements are a powerful tool to attract user attention, they must be “unobtrusive, brief, and subtle” (Laubheimer, 2020). The usage of motions should be restricted only to the necessary areas. Just like salt: overuse them will ruin the flavour; leave them out will leave recipe tastes bland.

## 2.2 Storytelling

### 2.2.1 Storytelling Overview

A story contains a series of information that makes up narrative. In history, various defination are set for story. "Narratives are stories", through storytelling, one can understand his own life better(Shankar et al,2001). Stories create the experience that fulfill the listener's desier of searching for emotions(Fournier, 1998). Another commonly seen story structure generally works like this: a character encounters some problem before he can reach his goal. At the moment of despair, a guide appears with a thorough plan, encourage him to take action, and finally help him get through multiple failures and achieved success(Miller, 2017).

Some insist the length of story should be limited to one message per story.

The voice of the public support the importance of storytelling. In a 2017 report, storytelling was rated the most effective marketing tactics among 62% of B2B marketers. The number of B2C storytelling supporter was even higher (The Science of Storytelling (Infographic), 2017). It is said that people are 22 times more likely to memorize a fact when they are presented in the form of a story (Ochs and Capps, 2009). Science backup the crucial role of storytelling - the human brain is hardwired for stories. Zak's research (2013) discovered story will increase the release of neurochemical oxytocin, the so-called "love hormone" and dopamine which contribute a long-lasting and more accurate memory. Besides, human tend to mirror their experience to the speaker's. Hence, after listenting to the story, the customer will perform a higher level of empathy and connection to a brand.

### 2.2.2 Storytelling In Brand

Storytelling benifts a brand in many ways. To begin with, storytelling remove the barrier of conneting to a brand. In the modern world, the information explosion feeds people with way too much noise (Miller, 2017). Luckily,storytelling is a powerful approach to create music out of noise. A well-choreographed music piece act like a map that leads the customer all the way through the product and services provided. In this case, the customer does not have to waste extra calories of their overloaded mind and can make a connection with a brand easily. Then storytelling convey the personality of a brand.

Not any random story will work as a persuasive brand story. Instead of talking merely about the brand itself, tell the story about the customer makes the customer care more (Miller, 2017). While Bragging about the quality of product or service is not the goal of a brand story, Establishing a stronger relationship between the brand and customer definitely is. The trick in storytelling is instead of showing the whole picture at the beginning, let the reader figure out the story on their own. As Andrew Stanton (2012), the world-famous film director once said in his TED: "Don't give them (the audience) 4, give them 2+2."

Some framework helps to structure a story that provides the better user experience, the previous study proposed frameworks like the persona-based model (Herskovitz, and Crystal,2010), the Hero’s Journey story framework (Campbell, 2008), story brand 7-Part framework (SB7 framework) (Miller, 2017) etc. Among which Miller's framework is the most comprehensive and easy to process for customers. Therefore this project plan to adapt Miller's work into practice. The SB7 framework proposes a 7-plot-points genuine story formula:

(1) _A character_, specially refers to a hero acted by the customer
(2) _A problem to solve_. If the character stays in forever peace, the story cannot move on. Therefore a villain usually exists to push forward the plot. In order to find out the villain of the story, two levels of problems, namely external and internal problems are all considered.
(3) _A guide_. The one who helps the hero to conquer all problems and win. The brand itself acts as the guidance of the hero.
(4) _A plan_ that takes away consumer's confusion.
(5) _Call to action_, challenge the character to take an actual step that brings them from challenge back to a peaceful life.
(6) _A vision of tragic ending_ that warns the customer what might happen if they do not follow the lead of this brand.
(7) _The glorious success_ illustrates the bright future of trusting this brand.

RE:source project largely built the storyline based on SB7 framework, with two user cases considered, the buyer and the donator.

### 2.2.3 interactive Storytelling

_需要改进_

Telling story online can pose more impact on users. Through the multiple media, ranging from visuals, animations and clickable interactive components that embedded in a website, multiple regions of the brain are activated.

_linear vs non-linear content (Checked http://www.uh.cu/static/documents/RDA/Web%202.0%20Storytelling%20c.pdf but need to do a bit more research before I can write a summary down)_

Storytelling itself is interactive by definition - in the words of National Storytelling Network (2020): "...storytelling emerges from the interaction and cooperative, coordinated efforts of teller and audience." Therefore storytelling is always a bidirectional communication. When it comes to the digital realm, the interactivity of storytelling becomes even more powerful. Interactivity affects how the pre-set information is interpreted and processed by users. Firstly, interactivity partly decides the amount of content on-page, for example, comment on products and discussion board threads. Secondly, interactivity brings a more customized feature to life, like the personal feed on a shopping website (Jensen et al, 2014). Thirdly, interactivity helps to pass the message of a brand. In several studies (Lee, 2005; Sundar, Kalyanaraman and Brown, 2003)the researchers emphasized that the higher level of interactivity the website have, the higher trust the brand earns.

Although many evidence touted the interactivity as a beneficial component, some researchers argue that under certain circumstances, rich interactivity might not be preferable. For example, rich interactivity brings more benefits on an entertainment website rather than an information-focus website (Liu and Shrum, 2002) and people prefer a less interactive website when facing time limit (Amichai-Hamburger, Fine and Goldstein, 2004). In conclusion, the setting of interactivity should be decided according to the own background of a brand.

### 2.2.4 Design elements in digital storytelling

_Data_
By Combining data and stories together, a brand will be able to touch its audience emotionally. Research has proved that emotionally connected customers are 52% more valuable than its highly satisfied counterparts, on average (Harvard Business Review,2015). The emotionally bond customers are less sensitive to price but more willing to revisit a brand and buy products. Data in the story can help in setting up the environment. For example, in a campaign that persuades people the importance of sustainability, the hard-hitting stats of how severe the environment has been damaged can give the audience an overview of the situation.

_Parallax Scrolling_
Parallax scrolling is an engaging techique that creates an illusion of depth in website pages. It attracts users to read more content. Research proved that parallax scrolling have positive impact on user experience through increasing the usability(Frederick et al,2015) and interactivity(Wang and Sundar, 2018). The downside of this strategy might be the increase loading time. To solve the problem, RE:souce will balance the amount of parallax effect and other required resources.

_emoji_
Emoji or emoticons are the digital images that carry the meaning of a certain emotion or depict an object. By March 2020, 3304 emojis already exists in the Unicode Standard (Emojipedia, 2020). The effect of these tiny images is enormous since 92% netizens reported they have the habits of using emoji in communication(Grabowski, 2016). The reason why emoji went viral is that they express the meaning more than it present. In the word of folklorist Lee-Ellen Marvin (1995) "[The] paralanguage of the internet, the winks which signal the playfulness of a statement over the seriousness it might denote." Hence digtial storytelling could use emoji to express more complex meaning and carry a familiar sense to customers. Extra bonus is that emoji in e-commerce environment has a positive effect on customers' purchase intention (Das et al, 2019) due to emotional contagion (Lohmann,2017).

### 2.2.5 Story-telling website case studies

_content here_

## 2.3. Sustainbility and second-hand market

### 2.3.1 Target audience's view on second-hand market

The secondhand market in China is at its nascent but growing dramatically. Research stated the recommerce market had reached \$71.1 billion in 2017 and is predicted to double the size by 2020. However, compared to the large secondhand market in the western world which can count up to 10% of its total GDP (Gross Domestic Product), Chinese secondhand market only made up around 0.6% of the total GDP in 2017 (Wang, 2019). Meanwhile, the second-hand economy in great Britain is the second-hand economy is thriving, with 42% of citizens selling pre-loved items in 2017 (Johnson, 2018).

There are several reasons why Chinese secondhand market is limited.

The traditional offline recycle bear the brunt first. From a cultural perspective, the older generation believed that second-hand items are not "lucky" since the reason they get abandoned remains unknown. For example, a car could be resold because it had gone through accidents. The new owner might have to deal with the bad luck brought by this car. Plus, some think it is beneath their dignity to use unwanted items. From a cognitive aspect, most charity shops are run by the government who seldom promote these charity services. The shortage of systematic marketing plan also causes trouble to the donate-selling business. Most importantly, the items in these shops are not included in the tax exemption policy. Therefore the price of the second-hand products is close to the market price, which is hardly attractive to the public. The most bizarre situation is that the price in some charity shop is even higher than the normal price - the extra fee is explained as the donation to charity. From an infrastructure perspective, the broken service chain has to take responsibility for the recycling dilemma. Recently there are more recycle box installed within the community. However, when the box is filled, nobody bothers to deliver them to the company in charge. Items packed in the box get rotten and smelly. In this case, people would rather directly dump their used stuff.

As for the online second-hand platforms, the concern mentioned most from the Chinese secondhand buyer is the reliability of the seller, followed by the questionable hygiene of second-hand products. Sometimes costumers receive the product that is not compatible to the images shown online (CBNData, 2019). In conclusion, a higher quality of product and the avoidance of scammer leads to a better second-hand shopping experience.

<br/>

# 3.Design Reseach

The segment of online shopping, in particular, online second-hand shopping had been grown the fastest worldwide in recent years (Fernando et al, 2016).It is also said that online second-hand markets had already become a crucial part of the circular economy (Hamari et al, 2016). The reason for setting up this sustainable project is to experiment with the effects of interactive storytelling on user experience in an e-commerce platform.

## 3.1 Project Brief

RE: source is a second-hand, sustainability-driven online marketplace serving sellers, outbound Chinese students and buyers, inbound Chinese students who are starting their education in the UK.

The sustainable component is adopted as a supporting marketing strategy. The previous case shows the "sustainable" movement potentially brings benefits. In 2013, IKEA Norway held a temporary online flea market collecting and reselling the used IKEA items. At the end of the 8-week-long campaign, IKEA announced the increase in furniture sale(Rudenko, 2013). In conclusion, the sustainable tag can actually have a positive effect on a brand. It also passes the message of being responsible and caring for the environment. "Protect the environment" is also listed in the top 10 motivators that significantly affect customer value(Harvard Business Review,2015).

## 3.2 Target Users

The UK Chinese student secondhand market might have a brighter future. The number of Chinese international student rank first in the 2017-2018 UK higher education(UKCISA, 2019). Almost 70% of the student enrolling in the UK education age under 25, which happens to be the most open age group to the idea of a circular economy (CBNData, 2019).Therefore, the RE: source platform target at Chinese UK student who has a huge potential to embrace the sustainable lifestyle.

## 3.3 The Offering

According to the brief questionnaire among 75 Chinese second-hand buyers, WeChat, the largest social media in China, turns out to be the No.1 channel Chinese students use for idle goods transaction. As a messaging app, WeChat provides a clunky, unorganised, and an uninformative shopping experience that requires users to tediously scroll through the group’s chat history, not knowing whether they will ﬁnd their desired item or whether the item is available. eBay and Gumtree are also mentioned as commonly used second-hand web applications. According to online feedbacks, These two platforms got many complaints about "the low quality of products, being scammed and the lake of customer service" (https://uk.trustpilot.com/).

As a business-to-consumer(B2C) second-hand e-commerce platform, RE:source will not only provide the service that deal with the problem mentioned above, but also optimize the user experience through storytelling.

In order to deal with the most commonly seen trust and scam issue on second-hand platform, RE:source solve the root of problem through choosing the path of B2C instead of P2P (Peer to peer) e-commerce. Since RE:source act as the seller who take care of the quality of used products, the user no longer have to worry about the reliability of the product provider. Furthermore, timely customer service are provided through email.

As for the storytelling part, the brand story will firstly persuade the donator and buyer to agree with our value. Then the website will try to provide the highly usable functions where the process of reserving doorstep donation collection service and searching for desired items are all simplified and optimized.

## 3.4 Project Value

First of all, the project helps to save natural resource and prevent unnecessary pollution by selling second-hand furniture to those in need. The value of used items is maximized in a new life. Secondly, as for the usage of fundings, apart from supporting the compulsory delivery and storage service, RE: source plan to use the profit to fund the artist who can upcycle the second-hand goods through in the future. Moreover, to deliver sustainable ideas to a larger audience, the brand also provide workshop which invites the public to participate in the redesign process.

Through closely cooperate with removal company, the reliability of service is guaranteed. As for the internal problem, the buyer is looking for a brand that they could rely on. Re: source is set to be considerate like a senior to the new students. "We know a bus trip to IKEA with tons of household items back is a hassle. Why not enjoy the bargain online? All stuff here is still good as new and directly delivered to your doorstep. " Accordingly, the website will lead the buyer through the purchasing process through caring micro-content.
