**Answer to last time feedback:**

1. No the topic right now does not relate to trust
2. The reference will be moved to bibliography later. Right now I list them right after each sections in order to track them easier.

**Practical work progress**
I am working on the prototype on Figma. https://www.figma.com/file/zXYrbEk50mHkd8sve990pG/Low-fidelity-model?node-id=0%3A1 It is a live preview, feel free to check at anytime.

According to plan, by Wednesday, I will be able to at least present a static low fidelity model, with as much illustrations as possible. I will try to build some motion graphic snippets on Codepen before the mid-term preview.

The transition between pages and detailed interaction on Figma will not be my priority. Might keep the current prototype static. I think as long as the logic is clear, build and debug the interaction on the real website is more important, do not have much time left since the user testing date is set to July 20th.

Here is the current version of storyline in case the "our-mission" page is not complete when you browse through the prototype:

Spacious and clean surroundings, abundant space to run and party.

That’s what we all want, right?

Bad news, the discarded belongings you throw away is stealing your space.
(Background illustration: A garbage vehicle dumping waste)

# Title

How to optimize the user experience in an e-commerce brand with online interactive storytelling

- The case of RE: source, a sustainable B2C second-hand platform

# Introduction

The following research questions are formulated:

1. What is good user experience?
2. What is online interactive storytelling?
3. How to optimize the user experience in an e-commerce brand with online interactive storytelling?

# Literature Review

## 1. User Experience

## 1.1 User Experience Design

The core of user experience is the user need. The second important criteria are the product or service has to bring joy and delight to the user (Norman and Nielsen, 2020).

Under the heading of user experience design, the main goal of a system is to improve its usefulness. (Norman and Nielsen, 2020). Usefulness is made up of two parts: usability, how easy it is to interact with the user interface, and utility, whether the system is functional enough with all the feature user need. The two sides supplement each other. A wonderful user interface with none of the needed function will be abandoned while a functional website with a poor interface that confuses user will disappoint its users.

## 1.2 Aarron Walter's Hierarchy of User Needs

Based on the Abraham Maslow's theory (Maslow and Lewis, 1987) which indicates a unidirectional linear relationship between the basic human needs and a higher level of motivation, Aarron Walter proposed a mirror hierarchy of user needs focus in the area of the interface. In this version of user needs pyramid, after the fulfilment of fundamental needs including functionality, reliability and usability comes the most superior needs, pleasure.

[Figure https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2017/02/07/aarron-walter-user-needs.png]

In other words, for the basic level, no matter how aesthetically perfect an application is, it will not be appreciated by users because of its lack in function. The reason why functionality matters is that, according to negativity bias, the user affected by the bad more than the good. (Ito et al., 1998) That is to say, a single function flaw will ruin the impression formed by many positive features. On the next level, if a fully functional interface acts unreliable, for example, breaking down all the time or does not provide trustworthy safety protection, it can hardly satisfy the target user. Moving upwards, an interface have to be easy to understand and navigate to be usable. Finally, the delightful interface features can be pursued. Specifically, animations, proper interactivity, well-presented microcontent like short and powerful titles, summaries, hints and tips that embed the characteristics of a brand(Loranger and Nielsen,2017), all contribute to delight.

## 1.3 Usability and user interface

_Typography_
Typography act as a core building block for a brand. After all, whenever a brand tries to convey a message or interface with customers through textual form, they have to rely on the support of typographic design. A proper text treatment will measurably affect user productivity and increase satisfaction in user experience.

Typography mainly servers two functions: establish the character of a brand and provide typographical hierarchy (Boulton, 2009). The features of a typeface reflect the intent of a brand. The whitespace in between letters, the various stress and weight all contribute to the changing "feeling" of a brand. Generally, the typographical hierarchy is dealing with contrast. It highlights the content that matters to the user most. Designers commonly create contrast between headings and body text through the adjustment of font size, weight and typeface. Since contrast contains the meaning of "difference", it is crucial to set distinct roles to fonts and their variants. And the role should be consistent within a website for a united brand feeling.

Based on the above discussion, Re: source adopted two typefaces: Merriweather and Helvetica Neue as its type scale. These two fonts are distinct from each other in design yet does not conflict. Merriweather is a serif font which is designed to be "pleasant to read on screens"(Google Fonts, 2020). Besides the slight offset of numbers in font produce a cheerful mood. Therefore RE: source use it as a body and price tag typeface. Helvetica Neue belongs to the most widely used sans serif font face family, Helvetica. Compared to its relatives, Helvetica Neue has a more unified set of heights and widths and abundant variants. The most copy within RE:source website is set to Helvetica Neue. Together, these two fonts form a harmonious combination.

Moreover, considering the different interpretation of font size on a different system, like Mac OS and Windows systems, and browsers, RE:source website use scalable measurement "em" in CSS to define font size.

_Color_

Colour helps to express the essence of a brand. When people see a rectangle yellow border, they will immediately recognize it as the "frame" sign for National Geographic.

Colours are capable to create an emotional reaction on user.
https://www.alterspark.com/wp-content/uploads/emotion-hue-wavelength.png
(Figure: Hue in wavelength)(Brian, 2019)
The visual colour map indicate that pleasue and control emotions peek in the blue zone. But blue is also the least arousing colour. In general, blue is associated with key word safety and comfort.

Most importantly, colour contributes to visual hierarchy which means the combination of colour guides user attention. Once user get to focus the main message sent by a brand, they are one step closer to build a short-term memory on the experience, then end up in a higher comprehension towards the brand. The core of visual hierarchy developing is not aesthetic but functional. Salience, the word that describe how noticeable something is, act as a key in visual hierarchy(Brian, 2019). By experimenting with saturation, shade and tint of different hue, the priority of elements can be adjusted accordingly. Nevertheless, some colour naturally perform more salient than their counterparts(Camgöz, 2000). According to the following figure, blue-green undoubtedly dominates others.

https://www.alterspark.com/wp-content/uploads/visual-salience.png
(Figure: Visual salience of colors)

In order to show the various status of information and express a clear hierarchy, RE:source chose the colour theme with one primary colour, blue, and five additional colours. Inspired by the visual salience chart above, green and orange are used as the secondary and third level of colour in priority. The overall elaborate colour theme helps RE:source to present readable and understandable content, pass the brand value of safe and reliable.

## 2 Storytelling

## 2.1 Storytelling Overview

A story contains a series of information that makes up plots. A commonly seen story generally works like this: a character encounters some problem before he can reach his goal. At the moment of despair, a guide appears with a thorough plan, encourage him to take action, and finally help him get through multiple failures and achieved success(Miller, 2017).

The voice of the public support the importance of storytelling. In a 2017 report, storytelling was rated the most effective marketing tactics among 62% of B2B marketers. The number of B2C storytelling supporter was even higher (The Science of Storytelling (Infographic), 2017). It is said that people are 22 times more likely to memorize a fact when they are presented in the form of a story (Ochs and Capps, 2009). Science backup the crucial role of storytelling - the human brain is hardwired for stories. Zak's research (2013) discovered story will increase the release of neurochemical oxytocin, the so-called "love hormone". As a result, the listener to the story will perform a higher level of empathy and connection to a brand.

## 2.2 Storytelling In Brand

In the modern world, the information explosion feeds people with way too much noise. Storytelling is a powerful approach to create music out of noise (Miller, 2017). A well-choreographed music piece act like a map that leads the customer all the way through the product and services provided. In this case, the customer does not have to waste extra calories of their overloaded mind and can make a connection with a brand easily.

Not any random story will work as a persuasive brand story. Instead of talking merely about the brand itself, tell the story about the customer makes the customer care more (Miller, 2017). While Bragging about the quality of product or service is not the goal of a brand story, Establishing a stronger relationship between the brand and customer definitely is.

Some framework helps to structure a story that provides the better user experience, the previous study proposed frameworks like the persona-based model (Herskovitz, and Crystal,2010), the Hero’s Journey story framework (Campbell, 2008), story brand 7-Part framework (SB7 framework) (Miller, 2017) etc. Among which Miller's framework is the most comprehensive and easy to process for customers. Therefore this project plan to adapt Miller's work into practice. The SB7 framework proposes a 7-plot-points genuine story formula: (1) _A character_, specially refers to a hero acted by the customer (2) _A problem to solve_. If the character stays in forever peace, the story cannot move on. Therefore a villain usually exists to push forward the plot. In order to find out the villain of the story, two levels of problems, namely external and internal problems are all considered. (3) _A guide_. The one who helps the hero to conquer all problems and win. The brand itself acts as the guidance of the hero. (4) _A plan_ that takes away consumer's confusion. (5) _Call to action_, challenge the character to take an actual step that brings them from challenge back to a peaceful life. (6) _A vision of tragic ending_ that warns the customer what might happen if they do not follow the lead of this brand. (7) _The glorious success_ illustrates the bright future of trusting this brand.

When put into practice, the RE: source project adopted the mentioned framework like this:
The guide is acted by the Re: source brand.

_Hero1: Donator:_
Donator refers to that Chinese student who is about to leave the UK in a hurry.

"Help the environmentalists to donate within 3 minutes. Save your time for something else you enjoy (subtitle)." This slogan pointed out the character of a donator: environmentalist.

The external problem of donator is to deal with a large amount of second-hand households within a limited time. The internal problem is the reluctance to resolve procrastination when facing hard-work with no rewards as well as the conflict of being a caring environmentalist or being a careless person who dumps the load in a landfill. Therefore the conversation on this page explained the idea "we hate taking heavy furniture downstairs and dump them as much as you do." In the end, there will be an image showing the character leaving without burden because they had already got rid of them through RE: source.

_Hero2: Buyer:_
In general, the buyer is mainly made up of freshers who just arrived in the UK and are still struggling to get used to the new environment and looking for a way to decorate their new life.

"Best bargain on the reliable used furniture in town. Your friend will be jealous."
Buyer face the external problem of paying a fortune for furniture that cannot be taken away and being scare to be scammed. In this case, to ease buyer's doubt, RE: source establish 7-day return policy, guarantee on-time delivery and quality of goods. As for the internal problem, the buyer is looking for a brand that they could rely on. Re: source is set to be considerate like a senior to the new students. "We know a bus trip to IKEA with tons of household items back is a hassle. Why not enjoy the bargain online? All stuff here is still good as new and directly delivered to your doorstep. " Accordingly, the website will lead the buyer through the purchasing process through caring micro-content.

## 2.3 Interactive Storytelling (Digital storytelling)

Storytelling itself is interactive by definition - in the words of National Storytelling Network (2020): "...storytelling emerges from the interaction and cooperative, coordinated efforts of teller and audience." Therefore storytelling is always a bidirectional communication.

Telling story online can pose more impact on users. Through the multiple media, ranging from visuals, animations and clickable interactive components that embedded in a website, multiple regions of the brain are activated.

The trick in storytelling is instead of showing the whole picture at the beginning, let the reader figure out the story on their own. As Andrew Stanton (2012), the world-famous film director once said in his TED: "Don't give them (the audience) 4, give them 2+2."

By Combining data and stories together, a brand will be able to touch its audience emotionally. Research has proved that emotionally connected customers are 52% more valuable than its highly satisfied counterparts, on average (Harvard Business Review,2015). The emotionally bond customers are less sensitive to price but more willing to revisit a brand and buy products. Data in the story can help in setting up the environment. For example, in a campaign that persuades people the importance of sustainability, the hard-hitting stats of how severe the environment has been damaged can give the audience an overview of the situation.

## 3. RE: source Project Brief

The segment of online shopping, in particular, online second-hand shopping had been grown the fastest worldwide in recent years (Fernando et al., 2016).It is also said that online second-hand markets had already become a crucial part of the circular economy (Hamari et al., 2016). The reason for setting up this sustainable project is to experiment with the effects of interactive storytelling on user experience in an e-commerce platform.

**THE PROJECT**
RE: source is a second-hand, sustainability-driven online marketplace serving sellers, outbound Chinese students and buyers, inbound Chinese students who are starting their education in the UK.

The sustainable component is adopted as a supporting marketing strategy. The previous case shows the "sustainable" movement potentially brings benefits. In 2013, IKEA Norway held a temporary online flea market collecting and reselling the used IKEA items. At the end of the 8-week-long campaign, IKEA announced the increase in furniture sale(Rudenko, 2013). In conclusion, the sustainable tag can actually have a positive effect on a brand. It also passes the message of being responsible and caring for the environment. "Protect the environment" is also listed in the top 10 motivators that significantly affect customer value(Harvard Business Review,2015).

**THE TARGET USERS**
The secondhand market in China is at its nascent but growing dramatically. Research stated the recommerce market had reached \$71.1 billion in 2017 and is predicted to double the size by 2020. However, compared to the large secondhand market in the western world which can count up to 10% of its total GDP (Gross Domestic Product), Chinese secondhand market only made up around 0.6% of the total GDP in 2017 (Wang, 2019). Meanwhile, the second-hand economy in great Britain is the second-hand economy is thriving, with 42% of citizens selling pre-loved items in 2017 (Johnson, 2018).

There are several reasons why Chinese secondhand market is limited.

The traditional offline recycle bear the brunt first. From a cultural perspective, the older generation believed that second-hand items are not "lucky" since the reason they get abandoned remains unknown. For example, a car could be resold because it had gone through accidents. The new owner might have to deal with the bad luck brought by this car. Plus, some think it is beneath their dignity to use unwanted items. From a cognitive aspect, most charity shops are run by the government who seldom promote these charity services. The shortage of systematic marketing plan also causes trouble to the donate-selling business. Most importantly, the items in these shops are not included in the tax exemption policy. Therefore the price of the second-hand products is close to the market price, which is hardly attractive to the public. The most bizarre situation is that the price in some charity shop is even higher than the normal price - the extra fee is explained as the donation to charity. From an infrastructure perspective, the broken service chain has to take responsibility for the recycling dilemma. Recently there are more recycle box installed within the community. However, when the box is filled, nobody bothers to deliver them to the company in charge. Items packed in the box get rotten and smelly. In this case, people would rather directly dump their used stuff.

As for the online second-hand platforms, the concern mentioned most from the Chinese secondhand buyer is the reliability of the seller, followed by the questionable hygiene of second-hand products. Sometimes costumers receive the product that is not compatible to the images shown online (CBNData, 2019). In conclusion, a higher quality of product and the avoidance of scammer leads to a better second-hand shopping experience.

The UK Chinese student secondhand market might have a brighter future. The number of Chinese international student rank first in the 2017-2018 UK higher education(UKCISA, 2019). Almost 70% of the student enrolling in the UK education age under 25, which happens to be the most open age group to the idea of a circular economy (CBNData, 2019).Therefore, the RE: source platform target at Chinese UK student who has a huge potential to embrace the sustainable lifestyle.

**THE OFFERING**

According to the brief questionnaire among 75 Chinese second-hand buyers, WeChat, the largest social media in China, turns out to be the No.1 channel Chinese students use for idle goods transaction. As a messaging app, WeChat provides a clunky, unorganised, and an uninformative shopping experience that requires users to tediously scroll through the group’s chat history, not knowing whether they will ﬁnd their desired item or whether the item is available. eBay and Gumtree are also mentioned as commonly used second-hand web applications. According to online feedbacks, These two platforms got many complaints about "the low quality of products, being scammed and the lake of customer service" (https://uk.trustpilot.com/). To find out more pain points, another research target at previous eBay and Gumtree users were carried out. _Research result goes here_

As a business-to-consumer(B2C) second-hand e-commerce platform, RE: source will provide an optimized second-hand donating and shopping experience through storytelling.
First of all, the brand story will be told to persuade the donator and buyer to agree with our value. Then the website will try to provide a highly usable platform where the process of reserving doorstep donation collection service and searching for desired items are all simplified and optimized. In order to solve the most commonly seen trust and scam problem on second-hand platform, timely advisory service through live chatting box and the traditional email communication are both available on the page.

**THE VALUE**
First of all, the project helps to save natural resource and prevent unnecessary pollution by selling second-hand furniture to those in need. The value of used items is maximized in a new life. Secondly, as for the usage of fundings, apart from supporting the compulsory delivery and storage service, RE: source plan to use the profit to fund the artist who can upcycle the second-hand goods through in the future. Moreover, to deliver sustainable ideas to a larger audience, the brand also provide workshop which invites the public to participate in the redesign process.

# Backup

# Conversational Storytelling

Conversational storytelling referes to a nonlinear, highly-visual, and narrative-based approach of presenting content. Escape from the traditional "momonologue" storytelling model, the conversation floating between two or more entities leads to a more immersive experience.
