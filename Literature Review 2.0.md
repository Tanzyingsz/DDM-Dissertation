# LITERATURE REVIEW

This study assesses the relationships between design attributes and the user experience in second-hand sustainable marketplace RE: source and evaluates the levels of brand trust to RE: source among (?) UK Chinese students.

A well-designed website should be able to produce satisfying user experience which includes: illustrate the necessary information of the product, build appropriate process that helps and retain user to access the desired information with ease and finally earn the user trust. Specifically, design attributes play a key role in raising the standard of trust between user and brand (Cheung, Chan, and Limayen, 2005) Therefore, developing an organized and user-friendly website is crucial for accumulating online customers with higher trust standard.

Within the domain of well-produced web design, there are five attributes proposed by previous design communities(Palmer and Jonathan,2002; Wang and Sylvain, 2007). Hereby list them as followed: Colour, typography, content quality, navigation and interactivity. While colour and typography are in the scope of visual design (Hasan, 2016); content quality, navigation and interactivity belongs to performance metrics (Palmer and Jonathan,2002).

# 1. Introduction to five important attributes

Within the domain of well-produced web design, there are five attributes proposed by previous design communities(Palmer and Jonathan,2002; Wang and Sylvain, 2007). Hereby list them as followed: Colour, typography, content quality, navigation and interactivity. While colour and typography are under the heading of visual design (Hasan, 2016) or aesthetic aspects(Faisal et al., 2016); content quality, navigation and interactivity belong to performance metrics (Palmer and Jonathan,2002).

## 1.1. Colour

First of all, as the basic component of the physical world, colour provides humankind with an incredible amount of information. When it comes to interacting with a brand, people carry out approximately 62‐90 per cent of their snap assessment based on colours alone(Singh,2016). Secondly, many studies have proved that colour has an effect on emotions states(Singh,2016; Kumar, 2017), both positive and negative. If the website is full of eye glaring colours, or colour without enough contrast, the user might generate feelings of irritation(Lim & Ting, 2012). Vice versa, a harmonious colour scheme that fits genetic psychology will please the public. Moreover, colour helps to communicate Brand Image since it represents the personality of a brand(Kumar, 2017). Therefore, carefully pick the colour and make it fits the genre of the brand is necessary.

However, It is worth mentioning that the effects of colour have an individual difference. Accordingly, website design has to take accessibility into consideration for the user with colour deficiency or other visual impairment (Lányi, 2017). One of the most efficient solutions is to avoid colour-only information. Use other elements like word description or pattern to enforce the message as well.

## 1.2. Typography

Typography is the carrier of content. It communicate information in the form of text. This element is closely connected to appearance and readability(Faisal, 2016). Through different combinations of typeface, font size, line-spacing and the space in between letters, typographical elements are able to present content in various format(Faisal, 2018). According to a study in MIT, these combinations have considerable effects on user's comprehension performance, mental workload and emotion state.(Larson, Kevin, et al, 2007) They prove that forming memorable association with a brand not only relate to content but also the way it is presented with apporiate typography. High-quality typography enhances the charactor of a brand because it reinforce the meaning of content in percived by consumers(Walker, 2020). Other study indicates that a clear and understandable typography format will ultimately affect the usability and recognition towards a brand(Pušnik, N., Podlesek, A. and Možina,2016). However, poorly-designed typography leads to negative feeling when user get visually confuse and unrelated to the brand (Walker, 2020).

## 1.3. Content Quality

Content quality assesses the information passed by the website and the service a brand provides. It also depicts the structure and presentation of content (Faisal, 2018). High-quality content plays a great role in raising user trust since it can effectively attract user attention and deliver the value of a brand (Rahimnia and Hassanzadeh, 2013). Therefore, the presentation of content should be accurate, easy-to-understand and up-to-date to meet the customer's need (Zhang et al., 2009). Accordingly, content quality could be further divided into three sub-categories:(1)_relevence_: signifying the pertinence of content to target customer; (2)_engagement_: the way content being presented and the degree to which the provided information is engaging; and(3)_timeliness_, measure how current the content is.

Specifically, apart from using traditional multi-media like video and images to explain content, there is another efficient way to elevate the user engagement - storytelling. Since the beginning of human history, storytelling has been used as the most natural way to communicate. (Patterson and Brown, 2005) Nowadays, storytelling has already been used as a powerful means for marketing strategy worldwide. (Pulizzi,2012) By telling a story, a brand adds authenticity to its content and therefore engage the audience more. Moreover, it is said that a strong brand story will emotionally bond with the customer more tightly and creates a longer span of brand trust in the customer's mind (Herskovitz and Crystal，2010). Therefore, marketers today tend to compelled stories into websites in order to persuade, entertain, and engage customers.

## 1.4. Navigation

Navigation includes layouts, images, paths design and clicks sequence (Bart, Yakov, et al, 2005). It refers to the ease of use: how easy it is for the user to find desired information and to move in around pages without getting lost. The ease of use then drives trustworthiness. As Roy et al. (2001) pointed out: “ease of navigation, interface design, and user guidance affect customer establishment for trust.” The reason behind is rather simple - when a user encounters a website with optimized navigation where they could reach the desired destination with a minimum number of click, they tend to believe the brand's capability of caring its user and finally lead to a rise a trust. Therefore the development of a website should not ignore the requirements of building easy-to-understand navigation.

## 1.5. Interactivity

Interactivity affects how the pre-set information is interpreted and processed by users. Firstly, interactivity partly decides the amount of content on-page, for example, comment on products and discussion board threads. Secondly, interactivity brings a more customized feature to life, like the personal feed on a shopping website (Jensen et al., 2014). Thirdly, interactivity helps to pass the message of a brand. In several studies (Lee, 2005; Sundar, Kalyanaraman and Brown, 2003)the researchers emphasized that the higher level of interactivity the website have, the higher trust the brand earns.

Although many evidence touted the interactivity as a beneficial component, some researchers argue that under certain circumstances, rich interactivity might not be preferable. For example, rich interactivity brings more benefits on an entertainment website rather than an information-focus website (Liu and Shrum, 2002) and people prefer a less interactive website when facing time limit (Amichai-Hamburger, Fine and Goldstein, 2004). In conclusion, the setting of interactivity should be decided according to the own background of a brand.

Generally, the evaluation of interactivity could be divided into 3 diverse categories: two-way communication, active control, and media synchronicity (Liu, 2003). The so-called two-way communication is the communication between the consumer and the group members of the website. Usually, this is done through email, chat, or feedback form. Social media facilitates are performed in the link or recommendations to a third party social media. Active control contains internal and external links, search function and language choice. Since active control provides a customized way for the user to browse the website, it should be aware that there is the user's trust might potentially be affected in a negative way (Jensen et al, 2014).

## 2. Trust in brands

## 2.1 What is trust?

Trust, in general, is the belief that one could collect what he desired from another. The basic trust between a consumer and a brand indicates the consumer holds a certain level of confidence in a brand. A deeper level of trust means a brand could produce value beyond the consumer's expectation(Ha, 2004).

Delgado et al. (2003) proposed trust can be divided into two dimensions: reliability and intensions. While reliability involves the ability of a brand to fulfil the needs of customers, intensions represent a brand taking care of customer welfare, for example, the promise of refund within 7 days or guarantee on dealing with unexpected problems. In conclusion, these two distinct dimensions define the trustworthiness of a brand.

## 2.2 Why trust is important to a brand?

It has been recognized and researched that building trust is crucial to e-commerce. Because the trust on a band will later build up the customer confidence and ensure the two utilities build up a long term relationship. (Doney and Cannon, 1997).

First, this firm relationship will substantially lead to a competitive brand with more economic advantage (Delgado‐Ballester and Munuera‐Alemán). The secret to maintaining trust is to deliver value to customers as promised. Meets consumer expectations consistently will gradually strengthen the bond. Eventually, the bond will become hard to break. This is the time when customers stick to one brand instead of its competitors. But be aware of not to satisfy everyone. After all, the capabilities of a brand are limited. The welfare of the target audience is the main concern.

Second, trust is built on positive satisfying customer experience. Those customers who had a favourable experience on the website are likely to develop positive attitudes towards a brand. Alone with a growing evaluation of trust, is the possibility of revisiting a brand page(Salam, 2005).

Third, according to previous cases, customers might give the brand they trust a second chance. In 2007, Coco-Cola company was lawsuits for allowing benzene in their product((Mercer, 2007). After Coco-Cola reformulated two of its soft drinks, the selling in that year dropped a bit but still maintain a considerable amount (UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSIONWashington, D.C. 20549FORM 10-K, 2008). That is to say, although encounter an unexpected product‐harm crisis, the brand survived thanks to the customers's trust in Coco-Cola brand.

## 3. Sustainable brand

## 3.1. What is a sustainable brand

_sustainability， sustainability principles_

Sustainability is a distinctive way of building a brand.

## 3.2. Sustainable project - RE: source (The project brief)

The number of online second-hand shopper increased exponentially worldwide in recent years. It is said that online second-hand markets had already become a crucial part of the circular economy (Hamari et al., 2016). The reason for setting up this sustainable project is to test out which web design attributes are best for instilling trust in online sustainable brands.

**THE PROJECT**
RE: source is a second-hand, sustainability-driven online marketplace serving sellers, outbound Chinese students and buyers, inbound Chinese students who are starting their education in the UK.

**THE OFFERING**
According to the brief questionnaire among 75 Chinese second-hand buyers, WeChat, the largest social media in China, turns out to be the No.1 channel Chinese students use for idle goods transaction. As a messaging app, WeChat provides a clunky, unorganised, and an uninformative shopping experience that requires users to tediously scroll through the group’s chat history, not knowing whether they will ﬁnd their desired item or whether the item is available. For the rest of mentioned platforms, users complain a lot about "the low quality of products, being scammed and the lake of customer service" (https://uk.trustpilot.com/).

As a business-to-consumer(B2C) second-hand e-commerce platform, RE: source will provide a better second-hand donating and shopping experience than its competitors. First of all, the process of reserving doorstep donation collection service will be simplified through the design of form. Then the crew will clean and check the donated items to ensure the quality. As the brand is the one that distributes the product, there is no fear of scamming any more. Next, the website will optimize the shopping experience based on the five design attributes mentioned above. To raise user trust, the brand also provides timely advisory service through live chatting box and Wechat. Of course, the traditional email communication will also be available in the page.

**THE TARGET USERS**
RE: source mainly target the UK Chinese students who only stay a short period of time in the UK. These users value the quality of life and efficiency. RE: source provides them with a way to achieve a higher standard of life with lower price and reduce their time on dealing with second-hand items.

These students might have to face the following dilemma: they have to spend a considerable amount of money on living items they bought on arrival. But when these students have to leave the UK, these items become a heavy burden since they are too hard to carry and there is no guarantee on being able to sell them. In the end, the living items end up in a landfill while they are still too-good-to-go.

**THE VALUE**
While reusing second-hand items is already a sustainable method, RE: source pushes forward the barrier to redesign the no-longer useable stuff. Moreover, to deliver sustainable ideas to a larger audience, the brand also provide workshop which invites the public to participate in the redesign process.

# Methodology

**1. How to define the design attributes that Chinese user cares most? (Qualitative research)**

A small range of open-ended survey online that involved 12 anonymous Chinese student studying in the UK is conducted. The aim of this survey is to find out what factors do Chinese student care most about a website that explains its brand well. 10 websites are selected out of over 200 award-winning candidates nominated by awwwards.com. No matter which area these websites target in, they have to convey the user it is a trustworthy brand. The whole dataset mananged to contain as many affective website elements as possible. Famous brand like Nike are not selected since the familiarity of big brand would have biased the evaluation on a brand. Additionally, the chosen websites have to be updated in the last 1 year. This specific critieria helps to make sure all websites are not behind the current website-design trend.

Each student got 4 random websites from the 10 website lists to test. Additionally, 2 students among the 12 were asked to comment on one more website. In the end, every website got 5 feedbacks.

There are 3 questions for each website. Students were asked to note down the advantage and disadvantage of the given websites. These first 2 questions are totally open, not limited to UI or Ux area. In this case, I can get a more general idea of a peer's taste. The third question is "How likely are you to recommend this website to your friend?" for a more quantifiable result.

_/\*Result of the research goes her\*/_

**2. How to measure trust (Quantitative research)**
With all the potential elements that might affect user's experience on a website is settled, the next stage is to carry out a quantitative analysis on the website RE:source built for the testing of this study.

The research included 50 anonynomous participents. Each participant was asked to fill in a form that asked them to mark the various design varaibles they encountered when browsing the websites. They were also asked to describe the brand with three adjectives. Finally,they were asked for a 'trust' score for the brand Addtionally, all participents were allowed no more than 90 seconds on each website. Since 90 seconds is the user need to form their first impression on a brand(Singh,2016).

FINDINGS

P.S.
online used product market = second hand market
