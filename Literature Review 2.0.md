# LITERATURE REVIEW

This study assesses the relationships between design attributes and the user experience in second-hand sustainable marketplace RE: source and evaluates the levels of brand trust to RE: source among (?) UK Chinese students.

A well-designed website should be able to produce satisfying user experience which includes: illustrate the necessary information of the product, build appropriate process that helps and retain user to access the desired information with ease and finally earn the user trust. Specifically, design attributes play a key role in raising the standard of trust between user and brand (Cheung, Chan, & Limayen, 2005) Therefore, developing an organized and user-friendly website is crucial for accumulating online customers with higher trust standard.

Within the domain of well-produced web design, there are five attributes proposed by previous design communities(Palmer and Jonathan,2002; Wang and Sylvain, 2007). Hereby list them as followed: Colour, typography, content quality, navigation and interactivity. While colour and typography are in the scope of visual design (Hasan, 2016); content quality, navigation and interactivity belongs to performance metrics (Palmer and Jonathan,2002).

## 1.1. Colour

First of all, as the basic component of the physical world, colour provides humankind with an incredible amount of information. When it comes to interacting with a brand, people carry out approximately 62‐90 per cent of their snap assessment based on colours alone(Singh,2016). Secondly, many studies have proved that colour has an effect on emotions states(Singh,2016; Kumar, 2017), both positive and negative. If the website is full of eye glaring colours, or colour without enough contrast, the user might generate feelings of irritation(Lim & Ting, 2012). Vice versa, a harmonious colour scheme that fits genetic psychology will please the public. Moreover, colour helps to communicate Brand Image since it represents the personality of a brand(Kumar, 2017). Therefore, carefully pick the colour and make it fits the genre of the brand is necessary.

However, It is worth mentioning that the effects of colour have an individual difference. Accordingly, website design has to take accessibility into consideration for the user with colour deficiency or other visual impairment (Lányi, 2017). One of the most efficient solutions is to avoid colour-only information. Use other elements like word description or pattern to enforce the message as well.

## 1.2. Typography

It is the elements closely connected to appearance and readability(Faisal, 2016).

## 1.3. Content Quality

Since the beginning of human history, storytelling has been used as the most natural way to communicate. (Patterson and Brown, 2005) Nowadays, storytelling has already been used as a powerful means for marketing strategy worldwide. (Pulizzi,2012)It is said that a strong brand story will emotionally bond with the customer more tightly and creates a longer span of brand image in customer's mind(Herskovitz, S. and Crystal, M., 2010). Therefore, marketers today tend to compelled stories into websites in order to persuade, entertain, and raise audience interest.

A small range of open-ended survey online that involved 12 anonymous Chinese student studying in the UK is conducted. The aim of this survey is to find out what factors do Chinese student care most about a website that explains its brand well. 10 websites are selected out of over 200 award-winning candidates nominated by awwwards.com. No matter which area these websites target in, they have to convey the user it is a trustworthy website. The whole dataset mananged to contain as many affective website elements as possible. Additionally, the chosen websites have to be updated in the last 1 year. This specific critieria helps to make sure all websites are not behind the current website-design trend.

Each student got 4 random websites from the 10 website lists to test. Additionally, 2 students among the 12 were asked to comment on one more website. In the end, every website got 5 feedbacks.

There are 3 questions for each website. Students were asked to note down the advantage and disadvantage of the given websites. These first 2 questions are totally open, not limited to UI or Ux area. In this case, I can get a more general idea of a peer's taste. The third question is "How likely are you to recommend this website to your friend?" for a more quantifiable result.
