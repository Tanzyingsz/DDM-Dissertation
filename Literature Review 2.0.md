### Project Brief

#### Design Pinciples

Considering the user-centered experience and shape-dominated visual style of RE:source, the desgin principles are built based on the design principles of the UK government (Government Design Principles, 2019) and Google Material Design(Material System Introduction, 2020). Detailed as followed:

**User comes first**

**Work hard, make it simple**
For the sake of users, make the whole experience simple. The brand serve as a guide, therefore, it is necessary to spend more time in developing the system that is easy to use. Which means guide the user to their destination, help them remember the customized helpful information and reuduce the noise that distract them.

**Use the power of shapes**

#### Budget

Based on the market price of website builders and servers, the budget is limited to no more than ￡ 100.

#### Deliverables

1. A Low-fidelity wireframe prepared for the development process.
2. A high fidelity wireframe for gaining early stage feedback.
3. The fully functional website.

Core consideration would be: how persuasive the setting of the story is, how fluent the pages are, how easy to navigate the shopping function and the overall performance. The efficiency of this website will be tested through user interview and assessed by some important website metrics, namely bounce rate and time spent on pages.
