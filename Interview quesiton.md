Our mission page quite like how you introduce about all the details and vivid visual graphics to introduce the process of how the things people donate and how the second hand will be resued and help to save the resources.

Ultimate goal save the environemnt whilst creating the convenience for people, and those who can benefits from the thing you don't want. You can also save space for yourself.

The goal of the page is to the things you may not necessarily want to have anymore.

It is clearly about donating the unwanted things and pass on to the others. Save yourself some time and space as well. (RE:source help people) to do so more conveniently compared to the tradiional way.

[Is it confusing that the cards are clickable.]
I don't find it confusing. I find them rather different compared to what I normally see and I actually find it quite cool as well. They are like the magical cards. It is actually something quite unique. It is easy to get used to and find out the detailed information as well.

For a story, you require step and require introduction as well.

[What the story is trying to persuade you?]
Enivronment is impacted by the wasted we've been producing. Through passing the unwanted things to others, we can do some pretty serious good to earth and environment.

[关于 figure]
I do really like how you put the figures which does help me to get to understand how much I could save by doing something really basic and easy for me to do.

Before this website, I did donate some second-hand stuff to charity shops however literlly no one, how useful the thing could have become. Through the storytelling, it help me realized what kind of goods I could have achieved.

[垃圾的部分]
childish and fun as well which remind me of the simpler time I had/.

[range slider]
I do really like this part and find them very engaging.

[是否要加真人的头像到用户反馈]
Won't make that much of a difference. The overtone of this website is not based around real images. Actully like the style you have already have.
But maybe real images like the video might pass on the point you tend to make clearer.

[福袋可以留言]That's lovely

[关于卡片]
Usually they have a button with "purchase" or "buy it". I can click on it and I know I can add the product to cart.

Quite mystery, make me more interested about this website.

[Donation]
I am a bit confuse where I can click. I thought I can just click the image and go directly to what I want to donate.

[表格页面]
The information in this page is clear and easy to add the amount of my donation.
This part is perfect.

[主页]
I love the geometric shapes and the contrast(vibrant) colour, quite modern.
[主页-hidden part]
make me curious about the information - "how the small change makes big impact."

[垃圾]
This is massive

[range slider]
"Woah!"

[Description to the website]
vivid adorable(icons minialistic and lovely) simplistic(the infinite staircase is northern european style)

[number]
the number you put on the website makes me think about how could we do to further improve our environment and how could we help ouselves, as human being.

When I see all the informations you wrote on the website, I feel like today we are making so many pollutions to the whole environment. If we can reuse the second-hand product, we can make poisitive impact to the environment. Maybe it's a little step but we can make a massive change.

[dislike]
frustrated to read the big-size number on the page. Maybe you acan reduce the size.s

(After reading the story)I am more likely to do something to help (improve) the environemnt.

As international student, we purchased some furniture from IKEA but we cannot bring it back to homeland. After we leave the United Kingdom, they become a huge wasted product. I would like to purchase them to help the whole environemnt.
