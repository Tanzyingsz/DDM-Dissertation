Why and how digital storytelling affects the user experience on website

- The case of RE:source, a B2C second-hand donation and shopping brand

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
ABSTRACT
1.INTRODUCTION
The main objective of this project is to explore the reason why storytelling affects user experience on e-commerce website and how storytelling achieve that. The dissertaton first draw the insights of digital storytelling from other researchers together, then explain how the theories work through case stuides. After the general discussion comes the detail introduction to the sustainbility ideas and structure design of RE:source. By incoporating the useful findings in research and studies, the RE:source website is built. Finally, …interviews.

The output of this dissertation is a fully functional second-hand donation and shopping website. The focus of the dissertation is digital storytelling which is largely shown on front-end. Hence, the back-end shopping functions like add-to-cart, payment APIs and product management system are made through Webflow, a website building a hosting service. Nevertheless, none template used. Every front-end parts are literally built from sketch.

The project is currently host under the domain https://re-source.live.

2.LITERATURE REVIEW
2.1 Storytelling
2.1.1 Start From The Origin: What Is Storytelling?
To understand digital storytelling, we should first start from the very basic - story. A story contains a series of information that makes up narrative. In history, various definations are set for story. "Narratives are stories", through storytelling, one can understand his own life better(Shankar et al, 2001). Stories create the experience that fulfill the listener's desire of searching for emotions(Fournier, 1998). "Human memory is story-based"(Schank, 1999) Human tend to store and retrieve information as stories. Therefore, people react to the information that is already a story faster and easier, and even experience pleasure in the process(Holt, 2013).

The approach to bring story to life is storytelling. Storytelling has been widely used becasue of it affects how people think and act. On one hand, science backup the crucial role of storytelling - the human brain is hardwired for stories. Neuroeconomist Zak discovered story will increase the release of neurochemical oxytocin, the so-called "love hormone" and dopamine which contribute a long-lasting and more accurate memory(Zak, 2013). Besides, human tend to mirror their experience to the speaker's. Hence, after listenting to the story, the customer will perform a higher level of empathy. On the other hand, the voice of the public support the importance of storytelling. In the 2017 report, storytelling was rated the most effective marketing tactics among 62% of B2B marketers. The number of B2C storytelling supporter was even higher (The Science of Storytelling (Infographic), 2017). It is said that people are 22 times more likely to memorize a fact when they are presented in the form of a story (Ochs and Capps, 2009).

2.1.2 Storytelling Structure
Framework helps to structure a story for a better user experience. Previous studies proposed frameworks like the persona-based model (Herskovitz and Crystal,2010), the Hero’s Journey story framework (Campbell, 2008), story brand 7-Part framework (SB7 framework) (Miller, 2017) etc. Among which Miller's framework is the most comprehensive and easy to process for customers. It emphasizes the influence of user instead of bragging about the importance of the storyteller - usually the brand who runs the website - itself. Therefore this project plan to adapt Miller's work into practice. The SB7 framework proposes a 7-plot-points genuine story formula:

(1) A character, specially refers to a hero acted by the reader. In this case, a story does not necessarily have an avatar to work.
(2) A problem to solve. If the character stays in forever peace, the story cannot move on. Therefore there is usually a villain to push forward the plot. What comes with a villian is a problem that mess up with the character.
(3) A guide. The one who helps the hero to conquer all problems and win. The brand itself acts as the guidance of the hero.
(4) A plan that takes away consumer's confusion.
(5) Call to action, challenge the character to take an actual step that brings them from challenge back to a peaceful life.
(6) A vision of tragic ending that warns the customer what might happen if they do not follow the lead of this brand.
(7) The glorious success illustrates the bright future of trusting this brand.

To illustrate how this story framework works, Let's take the first _Hunger Game_ movie as an example: Katniss Everdeen has to survive in a death tournament in order to save her home in District 12. She was mentored by the liquor-loving ex-tournament-winner Haymitch. Haymitch helped her planed and endear the public for supports which increased her chance of survival. [is a reference needed here?]Simply put, this SB7 framework works in many circumstances and engage the audience in a positive way. As a result, the storyline of RE:source project was largely based on SB7 framework, with two user cases considered, the buyer and the donor.

2.2 Ditial Storytelling
2.2.1 What is digital storytelling
The concept of digital storytelling first came up in the 1990s when the Center for Digital Storytelling began to held workshop that engage the audience who are willing to share their personal story (StoryCenter, 2005). Later on, as the internet developed, many have made an attempt to define digital storytelling(). Nevertheless, they all end up consider digital storytelling as a way to explain traditional storytelling through a mutlimedia way which involves music, video, images, animations and so on. However, the working defination in this study define digital storytelling as an interactive and engaging technology that tell stories in a multimedia way.

The key features of a digital storytelling in this dissertation are stated as followed:

Digital storytelling is web-based. Usually, the forms of digital covers a wider range of technique and format. The multimedia in digital storytelling includes but not limited to text, video, audio and sound effect etc. In practical environemnt, ground-breaking works like interactive TV series "Black Mirror: Bandersnatch" and immersive game "Detroit: Become Human" had greatly expand the border of digital storytelling form. However, to narrow the concept, the term digital storytelling used in this dissertation covers only the web-based narratives, namely website.

Digital storytelling is interactive.The interactivity is actually the greatest difference between classic storytelling and digital storytelling(Handler Miller,2008). Since digital storyteling is web-based, human-computer interaction is included. In this case, the interactive nature of digital storytelling directly switch the user identity from an "audience" to a "participant." Unlike traditional media, such as books and movies, where information act as a one-way flow, user's activity will influence the content on digital storytelling medium. For example, when interacting with a digital storytelling website, users are expecting the system to provide feedback as soon as they input or change the parameters on page.

Digital storytelling has various types. Digital storytelling could be applied to various gengres. Robin(2005) dedicated 3 main categories for digital storytelling: 1) personal narratives - a series of important incidents of one's personal life 2) historical documentaries – narratives about the historical events that helps to form a deeper understanding of the past and 3) stories for informing or instucting user about certain concept.

2.2.2 Why Digital Storytelling Affects User Experience?
Digital storytelling reduce noise on web
In the modern websites, the information explosion feeds people with way too much noise (Miller, 2017). Luckily, storytelling is a powerful approach to create music out of noise, since it emphasize the main ideas and weaken irrelevant information. Well-choreographed story act like a map that leads the customer all the way through the product and services provided. In this case, the customer does not have to overload their mental capacity and guide them towards the desired actions.

Digital storytelling increases comprehension

Digital storytelling enhances engagement

2.2.3 How Digital Storytelling On A Website Works? The Secret Formula
How to build enjoyable experience? The usage of colour
Color has a significant effect on digital storytelling experience. Colour contributes to the user experience in clarifying information through the visual hierarchy.
Visual hierarchy refers to the arrangement of element importance level. By experimenting with saturation, shade and tint of a different hue, the priority of elements can be adjusted accordingly(Brian, 2019). A clear visual hierarchy can help the user to comprehend website story content easier and guide their attention. In terms of comprehension, stuides have shown that compared to greyscale material online, coloured content increases comprehension by an astounishing 75%. And Text with highlight colour also works 14% better than bold text(Xerox, 2017). In terms of attention guidance, it has been proved that content with higher color saturation appears larger to eyes and command more attention (Hagtvedt and Brasel, 2017).

How to show the influence? The power of data
People are drawn to numbers. In the world full of uncertainty and scam, a static firm number offer the user a sense of reliability and add a counterweight to digital storytelling (Damodaran, 2017). Data in storytelling can convey information more vividly. For example, in the RE:source campaign that persuades people the importance of sustainability, the hard-hitting stats of how severe the environment has been damaged is more persuasive than a pure descriptive paragraph."Every person in the UK produce 409kg waste annually which is roughly the weight of 4 giant pandas" is better than "There are many wastes in the UK". People will get a quantitative sense of the waste and also feels the animal they cherished get hurt by their careless activity. Similarly, when it comes to stressing how an activity contributes to the environment, "We have saved 235000 grams of waste already" sounds more impressive than "We saved the environment."

How to hightlight the points? Typography and motion graphics helps
Studies pointed out that web users tend to scan web pages than reading word by word (Morkes and Nielsen, 1997) Therefore a clear visual hierarchy and attention-grabbing design of the key story part becomes crucial. Typography and motion graphics together makes the scanning experience easier and more understandable.

Typography act as one of the core building blocks for visual hierarchy. A proper text treatment will measurably affect user productivity and increase satisfaction in user experience(Boulton, 2009). Generally, the typographical hierarchy is dealing with contrast. It highlights the content that matters to the user most. Designers commonly create contrast between headings and body text through the adjustment of font size, weight, typeface and the whitespace in between letters. Since contrast contains the meaning of "difference", it is crucial to set distinct roles to fonts and their variants. And the role should be consistent within a website for united user experience.

Motion graphics is an advanced version of visual design that combines animation and static images together. They act as visual aids of text content. The most commonly seen form is short footage that aims to help break down the complex or abstract story. While the human brain already processes visual stimuli 60,000 times faster than text(3M Visual Systems Division, 2018), we are also more sensitive to moving objects(Beverley and Regan, 1980). That is to say, motion graphics not only improve the user interpretation speed on the story but capture their attention at the same time. What's more And the role of motion graphics actually exceed a simple information deliverer: they also direct the user sight along a certain direction or indicate the hierarchy.

How to increase user engagement? Gamify the experience
Researchers have considered gamification as a critical role in increasing the engagement in digital storytelling website due to its interactivity and its ability to bring joy and fun(Reeves and Read, 2009; Choe et. al, 2011). Gamification refers to the process that exerts game mechanics into a non-game environment. They are built to facilitate some desired behaviour and increase the engagement rate. (Huotari and Hamari, 2011) By using game-like elements in storytelling, the normal users are motivated as a "player" to get involved in the overall experience and do expected actions. For example, the progress bar in LinkedIn profile motivates the user to fill in more personal information. Other designs like badges, on-boarding journey and time constraints are all considered as gamification(Tubik Studio, 2017). Gamification makes a digital story more fun to navigate and Tasks and rewards it set stimuli people's curiosity and excitement. Consequently, people will spend more time on a website and immerse in the story more.

2.3 UI/UX Case Studies: Digital Storytelling On E-commerce Websites
2.3.1 Etsy - The vibrant global marketplace
Etsy introduces digital storytelling to convey user its value and build up an enjoyable user experience.

At the end of the Etsy main page, there is a hyperlink that leads to "our wonderfully weird story" which is already a humorous description. Within the link is a text-heavy but clean "About" page (https://www.etsy.com/uk/about). In regards to the visual structure, large-scale text takes up half of the space while motion graphics with a takes up the rest. All the keywords in the paragraph are highlighted with an underline, clicking any of them will reveal a hidden section of explanatory motion graphic. The low saturation colour scheme is comforting and consistent. Even though the overall tone of copyright is rather serious, the hand-drawing style motion graphics and Serif fonts brings a vintage and vibrant feeling to user.

[Figure: Screenshot of Etsy "ABOUT" page - the usage of motion graphics and data]

From the interaction perspective, the clickable keywords bring user entertainment because the hidden sections brings a bit of surprise excitement. Also, the persuasive data shown to act as powerful evidence of how to influence Etsy is and affects the user's emotion, from questioning to tursting. According to "Bandwagon effect", the user is more willing to be part of the community or take action when they see a large number of people had already done the same (Leibenstein, 1950). Also, the cat who poke out whenever the slider is clicked makes the interaction more fun.

[Figure: Screenshot of Etsy slider with cat]

After the user scrolls down the page, they will come to the darker section with a call-to-action button embedded. The visual cues of this part stand out thanks to the large area of a dark blue background. While scrolling this part, the motion graphics on the right-hand side change according to the content, just like a step guide that informs the users where they are. The animation expresses the process more intuitively than pure text. It helps to ease the anxiety of getting lost in pages and keep users on the page. Also, this section follows "the rule of odds" - an odd number of objects in an image is more interesting and appealing compare to even number objects (Zhang and Multiexposure, 2012). The easy-to-follow steps show the user how to be a seller or buyer and get access to help.

2.3.2 Dopper - The persuasive reusable bottle story
Dopper built an extremely immersive digital storytelling experience. (https://dopper.com/our-mission) Generally, the Dopper story follows the SB7 storytelling framework and prove that the framework works.

Following the description in 2.1.3 section, the user who read through the page is the hero while Dopper acts as the guide.

Firstly, Dopper places a bait and establish an undersea theme through its sea-like 3D environment and text description. The beginning part plants a question in potential customers’ mind - "What did single-use plastic do to our crystal clear water? Just as Andrew Stanton (2012), the world-famous film director once said in his TED: "Don't give them (the audience) 4, give them 2+2." Leave the task of figuring out what is going on to the reader. " Out of curiosity, the customer will continue to scoll down the page and linger longer. As for the sea-like environment setting, the scroll-down interaction is a clever metaphor of diving into the sea - as user browsing through the page, the background change from above sea level to underwater.Meanwhile, the colour get darker just like the dim light in the deep sea.

Then large scaring number of plastic waste jump into the page, while disgusting tiny plastic pieces floating in the background. These part throw out the environmental problem that the user and Dopper will solve together and is also the vision of tragic ending if the user refuses Dopper bottles. During this section, users might experience a certain level of shock, regret and will probably expect to find a way out in the rest content.

Thankfully, Dopper immediately presents its product as a solution to the terrifying situation. The full-angle presentation of water bottle along with copyright sentences targeted to the previous problems. Meanwhile, the background lights up and makes the scrolling experience more relaxed.

Furthermore, Dopper emphasizes its mission and impact by listing its actions and educational programs. Interestingly, the rule of odds appears once again. The slowly increasing number of plastic waste reduction vividly express the idea that Dopper is continuously making its contribution. Most importantly, the page introduces interaction into its process - when users slide the range bar, they will be able to see the impact they will have on the environment with buying Dopper product. "Kudos for reading this long story" shows the considerate attitude of the brand and bring the customer emotionally closer.This part illustrates the bright and meaningful future where the user will contribute to the greater good. Consequently, the impulse of purchasing a Dopper bottle is increased.

Finally, the button to the shopping section floats up, waiting for the user activity. "Our oceans will thank you." and "contribute to these cool things" increase the user proud and esteem even more. By this point, there is a high possibility the user might pursue to discover more in the shop. The whole cycle of digital storytelling ends thoroughly.

2.3.3 Analysis on UI/UX case studies
Comparing the two digtial storytelling cases, they both create a straightforward storytelling user experience and pass the information about their value and mission in a clean and artistic way. But the Dopper story is even more playful and persuasive.

They both had a clear visual hierarchy and empasize the call-to-action part with deep colour.
They heavily relied on statistics to convey the user their value and impact.

3. RE:source WEBSITE
   The goal of the story presented on RE:source is to convince the potential donor and buyer that they can make a difference to enviornemnt by answering the call for action on RE:source website.

3.1 Design Thinking : The Double Diamond Design process
The Double Diamond design model was first announced by the British Design Council early in 2015. It is an unlinear design process including four diverging and converging phases: discover, define, develop and deliver.Designers are enouraged to jump back and forth during the design process to either solve problem or improve the existed solution plan. The aim of this model is to guide designer on their way to create solutions to problems.

[Figure: Double diamond process]

RE:source adopted the Double Diamond design model into its design process and modified the details whenever needed.

3.1.1 Discover
As the first stage of the Double Diamond Design process, ths stage is used to observe the problem and established the initial questions.
【One-sentence to describe the problem, and the questions raised】

Background: China and UK second-hand market
The secondhand market in China is at its nascent but growing dramatically.
Statistics shows the Chinese recommerce market had reached \$71.1 billion in 2017, made up around 0.6% of the total GDP in 2017 and is predicted to double by 2020(Wang, 2019).However, compared to the large scale secondhand market in some western country, the Chinese market still have loads of room for improvement. For example, the total value of listed goods on Blocket, the largest Sweden online second-hand platform, corresponded to 11% of Swedish GDP (CASI, 2020).

There are several reasons why Chinese secondhand market is limited.

The traditional offline recycle bear the brunt first. From a cultural perspective, the older generation believed that second-hand items are not "lucky" since the reason they get abandoned remains unknown. For example, a car could be resold because it had gone through accidents. The new owner might have to deal with the bad luck brought by this car. Plus, some think it is beneath their dignity to use unwanted items.

From a cognitive aspect, most charity shops are run by the government who seldom promote these charity services. The shortage of systematic marketing plan also causes trouble to the donate-selling business. Most importantly, the items in these shops are not included in the tax exemption policy. Therefore the price of the second-hand products is close to the market price, which is hardly attractive to the public. It is reported that that the price in some charity shop is even higher than the normal price - the extra fee is explained as the donation to charity.
From an infrastructure perspective, the broken service chain has to take responsibility for the recycling dilemma. Recently there are more recycle box installed within the community. However, when the box is filled, nobody bothers to deliver them to the company in charge. Items packed in the box get rotten and smelly. In this case, people would rather directly dump their used stuff.

As for the online second-hand platforms, the concern mentioned most from the Chinese secondhand buyer is the reliability of the seller, followed by the questionable hygiene of second-hand products. Sometimes costumers receive the product that is not compatible with the images shown online (CBNData, 2019).

In conclusion, a higher quality of product and the avoidance of scammer leads to a better online second-hand shopping experience.

Brief competitor research
According to the brief questionnaire among 75 Chinese second-hand buyers, WeChat, the largest social media in China, turns out to be the No.1 channel Chinese students use for idle goods transaction. As a messaging app, WeChat provides a clunky, unorganised, and an uninformative shopping experience that requires users to tediously scroll through the group’s chat history, not knowing whether they will ﬁnd their desired item or whether the item is available. eBay and Gumtree are also mentioned as commonly used second-hand web applications. According to online reviews, these two platforms got many complaints about "the low quality of products, being scammed and the lake of customer service" (trustpilot, 2020).

3.1.2 Define - Project Brief
To synthesise the research, one should summarize raw findings and seek for insights based on the available materials.

Project Brief
【添加一个板块描述整个 business 怎么运行，怎么解决用户的问题，最后怎么给奖励。 网站的结构】
RE: source is a business-to-consumer(B2C) second-hand, sustainability-driven online marketplace serving sellers, outbound Chinese students and buyers, inbound Chinese students who are starting their education in the UK. RE:source collect second-hand items from donor and resell them to the buyers. The ultimate goal of RE:source is actively shape the perspectives mindset of environmental awareness and sustainability of the Chinese studying in the UK.

The sustainable component is adopted as a supporting marketing strategy. Some previous case shows the "sustainable" movement potentially brings benefits.For instance, in 2013, IKEA Norway held a temporary online flea market collecting and reselling the used IKEA items. At the end of the 8-week-long campaign, IKEA announced the increase in furniture sale(Rudenko, 2013). In conclusion, the sustainable tag can actually have a positive effect on a brand. It also passes the message of being responsible and caring for the environment. "Protect the environment" is also listed in the top 10 motivators that significantly affect customer value(Harvard Business Review,2015).

The overall style of RE:source will be simple and graphic, but staying functional.

Target Users
The UK Chinese student secondhand market might have a bright future. The number of Chinese international student rank first in the 2017-2018 UK higher education(UKCISA, 2019). Almost 70% of the student enrolling in the UK education age under 25, which happens to be the most open age group to the idea of a circular economy, (CBNData, 2019), the material loop concept of eliminating waste and realizing the full potential of products. Therefore, the RE: source platform target at Chinese UK student who has a huge potential to embrace the sustainable lifestyle.

The target user is divided into two types, donor and buyer. Donor refers to the student who tries to relieve second-hand burdens as soon as possible before leaving the UK. Buyers are the student who are about to begin their study in the UK or had just arrived for new semester. It is a common approach for the about-to-leave student to find new-coming students to take over pre-loved belongings. However due to the 2020 pandemic, many students are forced to leave the UK earlier. The start of the new semester is also delayed which means less student will arrive in the UK soon. In this case, there is a high possiblity the second-hand goods will go to the trash if nobody takes care of them.

RE:source act as the role to fill the time gap between the two bodies of the student. It temporarily store the second-hand goods and pass down the re-usable items from the seniors to the juniors.

The Offering
RE:source aims to provide reliable service and optimizes the user experience through storytelling.
In order to deal with the trust and scam issue on second-hand platform, RE:source solve the root of the problem through choosing the path of B2C instead of P2P (Peer to peer) e-commerce. Since RE:source take responsibility of checking the quality and usability of uesd items and provide genuine information on its website, the user no longer have to worry about the reliability of products. Furthermore, timely customer service is provided through email. Customer can always get the support they need.
As for the storytelling part, the brand story on website will firstly persuade the donor and buyer to agree with our value. Then the shop section on the website try to provide the highly usable functions where the process of reserving doorstep donation collection service and searching for desired items are all simplified and optimized.

Project Value
On one hand, the project helps to save natural resource and prevent unnecessary pollution by selling second-hand goods to those in need. Throwing re-usable items away leads to extra landfill, water pollution and waste on recyclable materials. However, manufacturing products potentially cause more impact on the environment. Apart from the same effects mentioned above, the manufacture also consumes a huge amount of materials, water, energy and produce carbon footprint on delivery. Reusing second-hand items is reducing newly manufactured ones. Thus RE:source brings positive impact to the environment. 【加入数据支持】

On the other hand, as for the usage of fundings, apart from supporting the compulsory delivery and storage service, RE: source plan to use the profit to fund the artist who are able to redesign the second-hand goods in the near future. This movement maximizes the value of used items and avoids the manufacture of the products that serve a similar function. For example, the cushion made by abandoned fabric can work equally well as the new. Also, RE:source delivers sustainable ideas to a larger audience through the workshop which invites the public to participate in the redesign process.

3.1.3 Develop - Prototype Iterations
This stage marks the actual start to finding the solutions. It requires prototype and continuous upgrading on the design.

Gamification: flipping cards
Instead of illustrating the lucky dip in a box-like or bag-like stereotype, the card-like design is inspired by tarot card. As the tool to tell fortune, tarot card is usually linked to the keyword "mysterious". The flipping card process is full of uncertainty, just like the nature of lucky dip. Conseqently, this gamification brings user excitement of finding out the hidden list on the back of card.

To improve the usability of these cards, the design had went through several changes. In the early stage, the pure card form without any description text raise confusion on users "I don't know they are clickabe" said a UI designer. Besides the flipping motion is laggy in this stage.Then through adding price tag below the cards, lukcy dips are easier to be recognized as a product to buy, but it is still not clear the cards link to other pages. In the end, the extra white background that stretch on hover provide enough feedback to users. The slow interaction is also solved through some tweaks on the div structure.

Here "the rule of odds" is proved to be right. At first there were 8 cards in the page. Users stop scrolling and lose the chance to see the following section. Because they saw the last two cards and "think the page ends here." After making to card number to 9, users no longer stop before the true ending comes.

3.1.4 Deliver - Development on Webflow
The last stage is to launch and test the final product.

Given the dissertation time constraint, RE:source chose Webflow as its development tool. Since Webflow's e-commerece system takes care of the backend data transmission, the author could purely focus on the story content, visual design and interactions.

4. CONCLUSION
   4.1 Evaluation of RE:source
   4.1.1 Method

Questions were focused on the user experience regarding the usability of the website, the emotional reaciton towrads the story and the overall feelling on engagement【加一个理论引用 e.g. Measuring storytelling Engagement】.
   4.1.2 Participants and Procedure
   3 students participated in this study. All of them are Chinese students currently studying or about to study in the UK. Every interviewee has no previous interaction with the website. This is to make sure the result is purely based on their first impression on the project. Participants were first asked to finsih 2 simple tasks : 1.Get to the last step of the donation process, the donation form 2.Get to the payment page of one product. Then they free to explore the "our-mission" storytelling page. After browsing through the whole website, the interview is conducted. All interviews were recorded.
   4.1.3 Results
   The interviews reveals that all users could finish the donation and shopping task relatively easily. "Quite straightforward" as they described. Even though "Our-mission" tab is usually neglected at the beginning - which is reasonable since storytelling is not a the priority function for a s

   Based on the feedbacks from interviews, the future version of RE:source might need a English to Chinese translation function, to help the target user navigate with the website. To achieve a deeper level of interactivity, social media could be intoduced into the system. For exmaple, build up blog system to hold the newest process of RE:source and allow people to contribute their own stories with RE:source through comment or sharing the content to other social media.

Question for Andrew
1.Am i doing the 2.3 UI/UX case studies in the right way? I analysis the storytelling page according to the elements I mentioned in 2.2.3 and descibed what I feel about them. I do not dare to call the section directly as "case study" since normal case stuides seems to have differenct approaches.

If I am not doing it right, What did I miss?

The greatest change for the structure is : combining the previous "Design research" and "Design method" into Chapter 3. in my opinion, the double diamond process cover these 2 sections to the first two "Discover" and "Define" step. What do you think of the structure right now?
