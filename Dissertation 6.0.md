### 2.1.1 What is Digital Storytelling?

The concept of digital storytelling first came up in the 1990s when the Center for Digital Storytelling began to held workshop that engage the audience who are willing to share their story.(StoryCenter, 2020) Later on, as the internet developed, many had tried to define digital storytelling. Nevertheless, they all end up consider digitral storytelling as a way to explain traditional storytelling through a mutlimedia way. Therefore, to understand digital storytelling, one should first define what storytelling is.

A story contains a series of information that makes up narrative. In history, various defination are set for story. "Narratives are stories", through storytelling, one can understand his own life better(Shankar et al,2001). Stories create the experience that fulfill the listener's desier of searching for emotions(Fournier, 1998). Another commonly seen story structure generally works like this: a character encounters some problem before they can reach his goal. At the moment of despair, a guide appears with a thorough plan, encourage him to take action, and finally help him get through multiple failures and achieved success(Miller, 2017) The latter further develop into a storytelling system called the story brand 7-Part framework (SB7 framework)(Miller, 2017).

Digital storytelling covers a wider range of technique and format. The multimedia in digital storytelling includes but not limited to text, video, audio and sound effect etc. In practical environemnt, ground-breaking works like interactive TV series, virtual reality, immersive game and web-based narratives greatly expand the border of digital storytelling form.

The greatest difference between classic storytelling and digital storytelling lies in interactivity(Handler Miller,2008). It directly change the user identity from an "audience" to a "participant." The old form of narrative follows a fixed linear manner while the storyline digital storytelling could be affected by the interaction between audience and materials provided.
