**Answer 1(interactive storytelling and user experience)**
The focus of my dissertation is to find out how interactive storytelling improve the user experience in a second-hand educational marketplace that aims at Chinese international student in UK.

The reason I bought up this topic is that Chinese international students must face in having to waste hundreds of pounds worth of living items that they bought on arrival when they leave the UK. Yet there is no efficient solution to help them deal with the problem. The RE:source marketplace I plan to build is going to provide an easy way out.

Running a marketplace is actually building a brand. Storytelling is a powerful way to emotionally connect the customers and the brand. The way of storytelling is not limited to paper or screen commercial these days. Interactive storytelling on a website might improve the user experience in some way. Therefore I would like to discover more in this area.
