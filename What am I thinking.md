The work I have done (till 6/20):
1.A small range but detailed research (12people) on 10 interactive storytelling websites. Each of the websites get comments on the pros/cons on its UI/UX. And also made a form about the design elements that appeared in these websites.

2.Some brief research on people's general comments on P2P well-known websites like gumtree, ebay - but not chinese student yet. Chinese student mainly use Wechat. Only a small part of them use the western platfroms.

3.The last literature review was based on the topic:"Which web design attributes are best for instilling trust in online sustainable brands" - feedback says the topic lack of interesting focus.

现在定题存在的冲突：
**educational 方向：**
怎么跟 second-hand furniture platform 结合起来，为什么一个 second-hand platform 要 educational？ -要么直接说是 educational 平台，附带二手家具销售 -要么二手家具销售为主，educate 的不是环保而是品牌。

motivate UK Chinese student to accept the concept of second hand furniture, and eventually change user behaviour 方向：怎么证明 user behaviour 被改变了

尝试描述一下项目：
My goal is to explore how to design a user-centred web application to provide UK Chinese students with an engaging alternative option to
the traditional P2P second-hand platform that teaches them nothing(???).

My main focus is on examining the design alternavies that builds up a better user interface, as well as how to present the environmental indformation to the students so that they can learn more through the shopping experience.
