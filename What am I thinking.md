The work I have done (till 6/20):
1.A small range but detailed research (12people) on 10 interactive storytelling websites. Each of the websites get comments on the pros/cons on its UI/UX. And also made a form about the design elements that appeared in these websites.

2.Some brief research on people's general comments on P2P well-known websites like gumtree, ebay - but not chinese student yet. Chinese student mainly use Wechat. Only a small part of them use the western platfroms.

3.The last literature review was based on the topic:"Which web design attributes are best for instilling trust in online sustainable brands" - feedback says the topic lack of interesting focus.

现在定题存在的冲突：
**educational 方向：**
怎么跟 second-hand furniture platform 结合起来，为什么一个 second-hand platform 要 educational？ -要么直接说是 educational 平台，附带二手家具销售 -要么二手家具销售为主，educate 的不是环保而是品牌。

motivate UK Chinese student to accept the concept of second hand furniture, and eventually change user behaviour 方向：怎么证明 user behaviour 被改变了

尝试描述一下项目：
My goal is to explore how to design a user-centred web application to provide UK Chinese students with an engaging alternative option to
the traditional P2P second-hand platform that teaches them nothing(???).

My main focus is on examining the design alternavies that builds up a better user interface, as well as how to present the environmental indformation to the students so that they can learn more through the shopping experience.

**二手数据**
The secondhand market in China is at its nascent but growing dramastically. Research stated the recommerce market had reached \$71.1 billion in 2017 and is predicted to double the size by 2020. However compared to the large secondhand market in the western world which can counts up to 10% of its total GDP(Gross Domestic Product), Chinese secondhand market only made up around 0.6% of the total GDP in 2017 (Wang, 2019). Meanwhile, the second-hand economy in the great Britian is second-hand economy is thriving, with a 42% of citizens selling pre-loved items in 2017 (Johnson, 2018). Therefore, the RE:source platform target at Chinese UK student who has a huge potential to change embrace the sustainable lifestyle than their western counterparts.

# Defination of words

## Story

A story has a beginning, a middle, and a cleanly wrapped-up ending

> Alexander, B., & Levine, A. (2008). Web 2.0 storytelling: Emergence of a new genre. EDUCAUSE review, 43(6), 40-56.

## Storytelling 让信息变得容易理解和记忆

Storytelling refers to framing information so that it is understandable, meaningful, and memorable.

## Interactive story 事件，现象和讨论主题都会实时变化

**Interactivity** is a live experience. In an **interactive story**, occurrences, phenomena, and topics of discussion are subject to change in real time, depending on the interactions of at least one person—a user.

> Spierling, U., Grasbon, D., Braun, N., & Iurgel, I. (2002). Setting the scene: playing digital director in interactive storytelling and creation. Computers & Graphics, 26(1), 31-44.

## Interactive storytelling 叙述者通过肢体语言，多种媒介进行解说，悬念和娱乐性（跟 VR 联系更紧密）

**Interactive storytelling** instead relies on a predefined story, a specific plot concerning facts and occurrences. Only the telling of the story is done interactively. The telling of a story involves presentation means, such as speech and body language of the narrator (poses, gestures, facial expressions), as well as mediated representations of narration, such as theater, film, graphics, comics, and the like. An interactive storyteller is an artist that reacts to the audience, while maintaining suspense and entertainment value. In order to accomplish this in an algorithmic way, we would have to implement not only anthropomorphic human behavior to a high degree, such as speech and gesture synthesis, but also a talent that not all humans share.

## Web2.0

Including microcontent and social media

**Microcontent**: 定义 authors create small chunks of content, with each chunk conveying a primary idea or concept. 举例 e.g. blog posts, wiki edits, YouTube comments, and Picasa images, audio (podcasts), video (for web platforms, such as YouTube) 特点（人人都能上手，内容至上）： Creating Web 2.0 content requires only making a fewselections from menus, choosing from a variety of well-designed templates, or adding a page name to another,already-established wiki page. One outcome of this authoring approach is a drastically lower bar for participation andpublishing.

**Social media**:举例 Web 2.0 tools are built to combine microcontent from different users with a shared interest: a blog post and a comment; a Delicious page for a URL with many different users having bookmarked the same URL; a group of Flickr photos from different peopleconnected by the common use of a descriptive tag; or multiple authors in a single wiki page. 内容是由很多人共同创造的 If readers closely examine a Web 2.0 project, they will find that it is often touched by multiple people, whether in the content creationor via associated comments or discussion areas. If they participate actively, by contributing content, we have whatmany call social media.

# Web2.0 storytelling (web-based storytelling)

Story can refer to either fiction or nonfiction. But Web 2.0 stories are often broader: they can represent history, fantasy, a presentation, a puzzle, a message, or something that blurs the boundaries of reality and fiction.

Not all Web 2.0 stories are distributed across multiple sites, but the combination of social media andm icrocontent makes it likely that many can be. （web2.0 倾向于让用户创造内容，用 hyperlink 连接不同网站的内容 PDF downlaods, blog posts）

the boundaries of Web 2.0 stories are not necessarily clear

\*Traditional storytelling has a limited ability on communicating content that trigger multiple psychological reactions.
