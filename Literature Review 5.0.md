# 1. Introduction

This project explore the realtionship between digital storytelling and user experience in the concept of e-commerce. Storytelling had always been a userful tool to express feeling. However, in the internet era, especially in the web2.0 environment, storytelling had exceeded the form of pure oral speaking and printed material and evolved to a more interactive form embedded with multi-media, interaction, micro-content and social media.

### 2.1.3 Storytelling In Brand

Storytelling benifts a brand in many ways. To begin with, storytelling remove the barrier of conneting to a brand. In the modern world, the information explosion feeds people with way too much noise (Miller, 2017). Luckily,storytelling is a powerful approach to create music out of noise. A well-choreographed music piece act like a map that leads the customer all the way through the product and services provided. In this case, the customer does not have to waste extra calories of their overloaded mind and can make a connection with a brand easily. Then storytelling convey the personality of a brand.

Not any random story will work as a persuasive brand story. Instead of talking merely about the brand itself, tell the story about the customer makes the customer care more (Miller, 2017). While Bragging about the quality of product or service is not the goal of a brand story, Establishing a stronger relationship between the brand and customer definitely is. The trick in storytelling is instead of showing the whole picture at the beginning, let the reader figure out the story on their own. As Andrew Stanton (2012), the world-famous film director once said in his TED: "Don't give them (the audience) 4, give them 2+2."

Some framework helps to structure a story that provides the better user experience, the previous study proposed frameworks like the persona-based model (Herskovitz, and Crystal,2010), the Hero’s Journey story framework (Campbell, 2008), story brand 7-Part framework (SB7 framework) (Miller, 2017) etc. Among which Miller's framework is the most comprehensive and easy to process for customers. Therefore this project plan to adapt Miller's work into practice. The SB7 framework proposes a 7-plot-points genuine story formula:

(1) _A character_, specially refers to a hero acted by the customer
(2) _A problem to solve_. If the character stays in forever peace, the story cannot move on. Therefore a villain usually exists to push forward the plot. In order to find out the villain of the story, two levels of problems, namely external and internal problems are all considered.
(3) _A guide_. The one who helps the hero to conquer all problems and win. The brand itself acts as the guidance of the hero.
(4) _A plan_ that takes away consumer's confusion.
(5) _Call to action_, challenge the character to take an actual step that brings them from challenge back to a peaceful life.
(6) _A vision of tragic ending_ that warns the customer what might happen if they do not follow the lead of this brand.
(7) _The glorious success_ illustrates the bright future of trusting this brand.

RE:source project largely built the storyline based on SB7 framework, with two user cases considered, the buyer and the donator.

### 2.1.4 Design elements in digital storytelling

【一句话】
**Data**
By Combining data and stories together, a brand will be able to touch its audience emotionally. Research has proved that emotionally connected customers are 52% more valuable than its highly satisfied counterparts, on average (Harvard Business Review,2015). The emotionally bond customers are less sensitive to price but more willing to revisit a brand and buy products. Data in the story can help in setting up the environment. For example, in a campaign that persuades people the importance of sustainability, the hard-hitting stats of how severe the environment has been damaged can give the audience an overview of the situation.

**Parallax Scrolling**
Parallax scrolling is an engaging techique that creates an illusion of depth in website pages. It attracts users to read more content. Research proved that parallax scrolling have positive impact on user experience through increasing the usability(Frederick et al,2015) and interactivity(Wang and Sundar, 2018). The downside of this strategy might be the increase loading time. To solve the problem, RE:souce will balance the amount of parallax effect and other required resources.

**Emoji**
Emoji or emoticons are the digital images that carry the meaning of a certain emotion or depict an object. By March 2020, 3304 emojis already exists in the Unicode Standard (Emojipedia, 2020). The effect of these tiny images is enormous since 92% netizens reported they have the habits of using emoji in communication(Grabowski, 2016). The reason why emoji went viral is that they express the meaning more than it present. In the word of folklorist Lee-Ellen Marvin (1995) "The paralanguage of the internet, the winks which signal the playfulness of a statement over the seriousness it might denote." Hence digtial storytelling could use emoji to express more complex meaning and carry a familiar sense to customers. Extra bonus is that emoji in e-commerce environment has a positive effect on customers' purchase intention (Das et al, 2019) due to emotional contagion (Lohmann,2017).

### 2.1.5 Digital Storytelling Website Case Studies

【storytelling case study】

Serveral online storytelling website inspire the design and development of RE:source.

## 2.2 User Experience

### 2.1.1 User Experience Design

【user experience design】
The core of user experience is the user need. The second important criteria are the product or service has to bring joy and delight to the user (Norman and Nielsen, 2020).

Under the heading of user experience design, the main goal of a system is to improve its usefulness. (Norman and Nielsen, 2020). Usefulness is made up of two parts: usability, how easy it is to interact with the user interface, and utility, whether the system is functional enough with all the feature user need. The two sides supplement each other. A wonderful user interface with none of the needed function will be abandoned while a functional website with a poor interface that confuses user will disappoint its users.

### 2.1.2 Aarron Walter's Hierarchy of User Needs

Based on the Abraham Maslow's theory (Maslow and Lewis, 1987) which indicates a unidirectional linear relationship between the basic human needs and a higher level of motivation, Aarron Walter proposed a mirror hierarchy of user needs focus in the area of the interface. In this version of user needs pyramid, after the fulfilment of fundamental needs including functionality, reliability and usability comes the most superior needs, pleasure.

https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2017/02/07/aarron-walter-user-needs.png
[Figure: Aarron Walter’s Hierarchy of User Needs]

In other words, for the basic level, no matter how aesthetically perfect an application is, it will not be appreciated by users because of its lack in function. The reason why functionality matters is that, according to negativity bias, the user affected by the bad more than the good. (Ito et al, 1998) That is to say, a single function flaw will ruin the impression formed by many positive features. On the next level, if a fully functional interface acts unreliable, for example, breaking down all the time or does not provide trustworthy safety protection, it can hardly satisfy the target user. Moving upwards, an interface have to be easy to understand and navigate to be usable. Finally, the delightful interface features can be pursued. Specifically, animations, proper interactivity, well-presented microcontent like short and powerful titles, summaries, hints and tips that embed the characteristics of a brand(Loranger and Nielsen,2017), all contribute to delight.

### 2.1.3 User Interface and Usability

**Typography**
Typography act as a core building block for a brand. After all, whenever a brand tries to convey a message or interface with customers through textual form, they have to rely on the support of typographic design. A proper text treatment will measurably affect user productivity and increase satisfaction in user experience.

Typography mainly servers two functions: establish the character of a brand and provide typographical hierarchy (Boulton, 2009). The features of a typeface reflect the intent of a brand. The whitespace in between letters, the various stress and weight all contribute to the changing "feeling" of a brand. Generally, the typographical hierarchy is dealing with contrast. It highlights the content that matters to the user most. Designers commonly create contrast between headings and body text through the adjustment of font size, weight and typeface. Since contrast contains the meaning of "difference", it is crucial to set distinct roles to fonts and their variants. And the role should be consistent within a website for a united brand feeling.

Moreover, considering the different interpretation of font size on a different system, like Mac OS and Windows systems, and browsers, RE:source website use scalable measurement "em" in CSS to define font size.

> Boulton, M., 2009. A practical guide to designing for the web. Mark Boulton Design Limited.

**Color**

Overall, colour contributes to the user interface in three dimensions: pass information through visual hierarchy, arouse emotional responses from users and shape the brand image.

Firstly, as the basic component of the physical world, colour provides humankind with an incredible amount of information. Studies shows that when interacting with a brand, people carry out approximately 62‐90 per cent of their snap assessment based on colours alone(Singh,2016). To communicate the information clearly, one can use colour to build an visual hierarchy. Visual hierarchy can show help the user to understand website structure eaiser and guide user attention. Once user get to focus the main message sent by a brand, they are one step closer to build a short-term memory on the experience, then end up in a higher comprehension towards the brand. The core of visual hierarchy development is not aesthetic but functional. Salience, the description of how noticeable something is, act as a key in visual hierarchy(Brian, 2019). By experimenting with saturation, shade and tint of different hue, the priority of elements can be adjusted accordingly. Nevertheless, some colour naturally perform more salient than their counterparts(Camgöz, 2000). According to the following figure, blue-green undoubtedly dominates others.

https://www.alterspark.com/wp-content/uploads/visual-salience.png
(Figure: Visual salience of colors)

Secondly, many studies have proved that colour has an effect on emotions states(Singh,2016; Kumar, 2017), both positive and negative. If the website is full of eye glaring colours, or colour without enough contrast, the user might generate feelings of irritation(Lim & Ting, 2012). Vice versa, a harmonious colour scheme that fits genetic psychology will please the public.

ttps://www.alterspark.com/wp-content/uploads/emotion-hue-wavelength.png
(Figure: Hue in wavelength)

The visual colour map indicate that pleasue and control emotions peek in the blue zone. Blue is also said to be associated with key word safety and comfort.(Brian, 2019)

Thirdly, colour helps to communicate brand image since it represents the personality of a brand(Kumar, 2017).For instances, when people see a rectangle yellow border, they will immediately recognize it as the "frame" sign for National Geographic. Therefore, carefully pick the colour and make it fits the genre of the brand is necessary.As Seo (2010) pointed out, the colour green in a sustainable brand gets more positive responsive on environmental messages, RE:source used green as the brand logo colour.

However, It is worth mentioning that the effects of colour have an individual difference. Accordingly, website design has to take accessibility into consideration for the user with colour deficiency or other visual impairment (Lányi, 2017). One of the most efficient solutions is to avoid colour-only information. Use other elements like word description or pattern to enforce the message as well.

<br/>

**Motion Design**

A cohesive motion system can improve the user experience by reflecting the brand personality and providing clearer feedbacks(Goyeneche, 2020).<br/>

The animation in motion design can express the tone and voice of a brand. For example, the transition between different pages and state-change can be either playful or subtle. They represent two different kinds of brand personalities - cheerful or calm. However, the designer should be really careful when it comes to a larger project - animations should be consistent throughout the user experience. For instances, if hover on the buttons with same function triggers various animation, user will confuse about the meaning of these movement - are they just a fancy decoration or actually points to different status? According to the "12 Principles of Animation" (Thomas et al., 1995), the volumn, staging and lighting and the transition from frame to frame should all considered in a well-developed motion system.<br/>

In the scenarios where the user has to wait for feedback when submitting forms or waiting for loading, animations could provide the status of the system through visualized bar, numbers or focus area. In some cases, interactive animations even help to break complicated information down. Compared to static image, a sequence of animation increase the content capacity and reduce the effort to understand information. Here, the Apple Card informs users the charges range through the circular animation. The animation expresses the process more Intuitively than a long paragraph. These meaningful details are like the tiny hopes within websites. They tell the user “something is going to happen”, ease the user anxiety, help them to avoid common mistakes and keep them from leaving.<br/>

<br/>[Figure: Video Screenshot from Apple Card App]

Of course, even though moving elements are a powerful tool to attract user attention, they must be “unobtrusive, brief, and subtle” (Laubheimer, 2020). The usage of motions should be restricted only to the necessary areas. Just like salt: overuse them will ruin the flavour; leave them out will leave recipe tastes bland.<br/>

## 2.3 Limited Chinese second-hand market and the potential in its UK counterpart

The secondhand market in China is at its nascent but growing dramatically. <br/>

Research stated the recommerce market had reached \$71.1 billion in 2017 and is predicted to double the size by 2020. However, compared to the large secondhand market in the western world which can count up to 10% of its total GDP (Gross Domestic Product), Chinese secondhand market only made up around 0.6% of the total GDP in 2017 (Wang, 2019). Meanwhile, the second-hand economy in great Britain is the second-hand economy is thriving, with 42% of citizens selling pre-loved items in 2017 (Johnson, 2018).<br/>

There are several reasons why Chinese secondhand market is limited.<br/>

The traditional offline recycle bear the brunt first. From a cultural perspective, the older generation believed that second-hand items are not "lucky" since the reason they get abandoned remains unknown. For example, a car could be resold because it had gone through accidents. The new owner might have to deal with the bad luck brought by this car. Plus, some think it is beneath their dignity to use unwanted items. From a cognitive aspect, most charity shops are run by the government who seldom promote these charity services. The shortage of systematic marketing plan also causes trouble to the donate-selling business. Most importantly, the items in these shops are not included in the tax exemption policy. Therefore the price of the second-hand products is close to the market price, which is hardly attractive to the public. The most bizarre situation is that the price in some charity shop is even higher than the normal price - the extra fee is explained as the donation to charity. From an infrastructure perspective, the broken service chain has to take responsibility for the recycling dilemma. Recently there are more recycle box installed within the community. However, when the box is filled, nobody bothers to deliver them to the company in charge. Items packed in the box get rotten and smelly. In this case, people would rather directly dump their used stuff.<br/>

As for the online second-hand platforms, the concern mentioned most from the Chinese secondhand buyer is the reliability of the seller, followed by the questionable hygiene of second-hand products. Sometimes costumers receive the product that is not compatible to the images shown online (CBNData, 2019). <br/>

In conclusion, a higher quality of product and the avoidance of scammer leads to a better online second-hand shopping experience.<br/><br/>

# 3.Design Reseach

The segment of online shopping, in particular, online second-hand shopping had been grown the fastest worldwide in recent years (Fernando et al, 2016).It is also said that online second-hand markets had already become a crucial part of the circular economy (Hamari et al, 2016). The reason for setting up this sustainable project is to experiment with the effects of digital storytelling on user experience in an e-commerce brand.

## 3.1 Second-hand Market Case Studies

【竞品分析】

## 3.2 Project Brief

RE: source is a second-hand, sustainability-driven online marketplace serving sellers, outbound Chinese students and buyers, inbound Chinese students who are starting their education in the UK. The ultimate goal of RE:source is actively shape the perspectives mindset of environmental awareness and sustainability of the future China young thought leaders in the UK.<br/>

The sustainable component is adopted as a supporting marketing strategy. The previous case shows the "sustainable" movement potentially brings benefits. In 2013, IKEA Norway held a temporary online flea market collecting and reselling the used IKEA items. At the end of the 8-week-long campaign, IKEA announced the increase in furniture sale(Rudenko, 2013). In conclusion, the sustainable tag can actually have a positive effect on a brand. It also passes the message of being responsible and caring for the environment. "Protect the environment" is also listed in the top 10 motivators that significantly affect customer value(Harvard Business Review,2015).<br/>

The overall style of RE:source will be simple and graphic, but staying functional.<br/><br/>

## 3.3 Target Users

The UK Chinese student secondhand market might have a brighter future. The number of Chinese international student rank first in the 2017-2018 UK higher education(UKCISA, 2019). Almost 70% of the student enrolling in the UK education age under 25, which happens to be the most open age group to the idea of a circular economy (CBNData, 2019).Therefore, the RE: source platform target at Chinese UK student who has a huge potential to embrace the sustainable lifestyle.<br/>

The target user is divided into two types, donator and buyer. While donator, the Chinese student who tries to get rid of second-hand burdens, the next round of student buyer had not yet arrived. Especially due to the 2020 pandemic, the beginning of the on-site semester postponed and some of the students swtich to online learning. In general, there is a time gap between the two bodies of the student. RE:source link them together and pass down the re-usable items from the seniors to the juniors.<br/><br/>

## 3.4 The Offering

According to the brief questionnaire among 75 Chinese second-hand buyers, WeChat, the largest social media in China, turns out to be the No.1 channel Chinese students use for idle goods transaction. As a messaging app, WeChat provides a clunky, unorganised, and an uninformative shopping experience that requires users to tediously scroll through the group’s chat history, not knowing whether they will ﬁnd their desired item or whether the item is available. eBay and Gumtree are also mentioned as commonly used second-hand web applications. According to online feedbacks, These two platforms got many complaints about "the low quality of products, being scammed and the lake of customer service" (https://uk.trustpilot.com/).<br/>

As a business-to-consumer(B2C) second-hand e-commerce platform, RE:source will not only provide the service that deals with the problem mentioned above but also optimizes the user experience through storytelling.<br/>

In order to deal with the most commonly seen trust and scam issue on second-hand platform, RE:source solve the root of the problem through choosing the path of B2C instead of P2P (Peer to peer) e-commerce. Since RE:source act as the seller who takes care of the quality of used products, the user no longer have to worry about the reliability of the product provider. Furthermore, timely customer service is provided through email.<br/>

As for the storytelling part, the brand story will firstly persuade the donator and buyer to agree with our value. Then the website will try to provide the highly usable functions where the process of reserving doorstep donation collection service and searching for desired items are all simplified and optimized.<br/><br/>

## 3.5 Project Value

On one hand, the project helps to save natural resource and prevent unnecessary pollution by selling second-hand goods to those in need. Throwing re-usable items away leads to extra landfill, water pollution and waste on recyclable materials. However, manufacturing products potentially cause more impact on the environment. Apart from the same effects mentioned above, the manufacture also consumes a huge amount of materials, water, energy and produce carbon footprint on delivery. Reusing second-hand items is reducing newly manufactured ones. Thus RE:source brings positive impact to the environment.<br/>

On the other hand, as for the usage of fundings, apart from supporting the compulsory delivery and storage service, RE: source plan to use the profit to fund the artist who can upcycle the second-hand goods through in the future. This movement maximize the value of used items and avoid the manufacture of the products that serve a similar function. Also, the brand deliver sustainable ideas to a larger audience through a workshop which invites the public to participate in the redesign process.<br/><br/>

# 4. Design Methodology

## 4.1 The Storytelling in RE:source - based on SB7 framework

The implement of RE:source storytelling is based on SB7 framework. The project mainly deal with two kind of users: donator and buyer. Since all the selling products are recycled from donation, the narrative of storyline begins from donator, and then switch to buyer. The presentation of donor story goes to the donation guide page, while our-mission page targets at the painpoints of buyers.<br/>

After analysising the user problems, RE:source adapt the SB7 framework as followed:<br/>

The guide in both user cases acted by the Re: source brand.<br/>

**Hero story 1: Donator**
Donator refers to that Chinese student who is about to leave the UK in a hurry.<br/>

"Help the environmentalists to donate within 10 minutes. Save your time for something else you enjoy (subtitle)." This slogan pointed out the character of a donator: environmentalist.<br/>

The external problem of donator is to deal with a large amount of second-hand households within a limited time. The internal problem is the reluctance to resolve procrastination when facing hard-work with no rewards as well as the conflict of being a caring environmentalist or being a careless person who dumps the load in a landfill.<br/>

Therefore the story on related page explained the idea "we hate taking bulky items downstairs and dump them as much as you do." The solution provided by RE:source is free donation collecting service. Step-by-step guide and carefully-desigend form process will simplify the donation register process. As a result, there might be a higher possibility the user take part in donation. As for the reward, Miller(2017) stressed offering a status in return. Thus, donator will get an certification with his memership as a RE: source support and all the detailed contribution he made to the environment. A certification brings up the feeling of rewarded and being affirmed. At the end of the story, the sucess should be depicted with an image shows the character leaving UK without burden.<br/><br/>

**Hero story 2: Buyer**
In general, the buyer is mainly made up of first year students who just arrived in the UK and are still struggling to get used to the new environment and looking for a way to decorate their new life.<br/>

"Best bargain, reliable prodcuts." The slogan pointed out the price and quality advantage of RE:source products.<br/>

### 4.2.2 Usability of RE:source

In order to keep consistency throughout the user experience, RE:source developed a design system that stores all the necessary elements that will be reused multiple times. Applying the design elements metioned in the previous section(2.1.3), RE:source planned to carry out the typography, colour scheme and motion design as follwed:

**(1)Colour**
In order to show the various status of information and express a clear hierarchy, RE:source picked the colour theme with one primary colour, blue, and five additional colours. Inspired by the visual salience chart above, green and orange are used as the secondary and third level of colour in priority. The overall elaborate colour theme helps RE:source to present readable and understandable content, pass the brand value of safe and reliable.

Considering accessibility, content are not only distinguished through colour, but also explanation text or various patterns.

Re:source adopted two typefaces: Merriweather and Merriweather Sans as its type scale. These two fonts belongs to the same font family yet distinct from each other. Merriweather is a serif font which is designed to be "pleasant to read on screens"(Google Fonts, 2020). Besides the slight offset of numbers in font produce a cheerful mood. Therefore RE: source use it as a body and price tag typeface. Compared to its relatives, the semi-condensed sans-serif Merriweather Sans has a more modern shapes and feelings. It contains more power when used in larger font. Therefore, the most copy within RE:source website is set to Merriweather Sans. Together, these two fonts form a harmonious combination.

**(3)Motion Design**
The main motions used in Re:source are the status change of button, the horizontal transformation of paragraph and some animation that connects the storyline. The animations are either triggered on hover, scrolling or mouse movement.
