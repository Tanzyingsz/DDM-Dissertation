# 3.Design Reseach

The segment of online shopping, in particular, online second-hand shopping had been grown the fastest worldwide in recent years (Fernando et al, 2016).It is also said that online second-hand markets had already become a crucial part of the circular economy (Hamari et al, 2016). The reason for setting up this sustainable project is to experiment with the effects of interactive storytelling on user experience in an e-commerce platform.

## 3.1 Competitor case studies

## 3.2 Project Brief

RE: source is a second-hand, sustainability-driven online marketplace serving sellers, outbound Chinese students and buyers, inbound Chinese students who are starting their education in the UK. The ultimate goal of RE:source is actively shape the perspectives mindset of environmental awareness and sustainability of the future China young thought leaders in the UK.

The sustainable component is adopted as a supporting marketing strategy. The previous case shows the "sustainable" movement potentially brings benefits. In 2013, IKEA Norway held a temporary online flea market collecting and reselling the used IKEA items. At the end of the 8-week-long campaign, IKEA announced the increase in furniture sale(Rudenko, 2013). In conclusion, the sustainable tag can actually have a positive effect on a brand. It also passes the message of being responsible and caring for the environment. "Protect the environment" is also listed in the top 10 motivators that significantly affect customer value(Harvard Business Review,2015).

The overall style of RE:source will be simple and graphic, but staying functional.

## 3.3 Target Users

The UK Chinese student secondhand market might have a brighter future. The number of Chinese international student rank first in the 2017-2018 UK higher education(UKCISA, 2019). Almost 70% of the student enrolling in the UK education age under 25, which happens to be the most open age group to the idea of a circular economy (CBNData, 2019).Therefore, the RE: source platform target at Chinese UK student who has a huge potential to embrace the sustainable lifestyle.

The target user is divided into two types, donator and buyer. While donator, the Chinese student who tries to get rid of second-hand burdens, the next round of student buyer had not yet arrived. Especially due to the 2020 pandemic, the beginning of the on-site semester postponed and some of the students swtich to online learning. In general, there is a time gap between the two bodies of the student. RE:source link them together and pass down the re-usable items from the seniors to the juniors.

## 3.4 The Offering

According to the brief questionnaire among 75 Chinese second-hand buyers, WeChat, the largest social media in China, turns out to be the No.1 channel Chinese students use for idle goods transaction. As a messaging app, WeChat provides a clunky, unorganised, and an uninformative shopping experience that requires users to tediously scroll through the group’s chat history, not knowing whether they will ﬁnd their desired item or whether the item is available. eBay and Gumtree are also mentioned as commonly used second-hand web applications. According to online feedbacks, These two platforms got many complaints about "the low quality of products, being scammed and the lake of customer service" (https://uk.trustpilot.com/).

As a business-to-consumer(B2C) second-hand e-commerce platform, RE:source will not only provide the service that deals with the problem mentioned above but also optimizes the user experience through storytelling.

In order to deal with the most commonly seen trust and scam issue on second-hand platform, RE:source solve the root of the problem through choosing the path of B2C instead of P2P (Peer to peer) e-commerce. Since RE:source act as the seller who takes care of the quality of used products, the user no longer have to worry about the reliability of the product provider. Furthermore, timely customer service is provided through email.

As for the storytelling part, the brand story will firstly persuade the donator and buyer to agree with our value. Then the website will try to provide the highly usable functions where the process of reserving doorstep donation collection service and searching for desired items are all simplified and optimized.

## 3.5 Project Value

On one hand, the project helps to save natural resource and prevent unnecessary pollution by selling second-hand goods to those in need. Throwing re-usable items away leads to extra landfill, water pollution and waste on recyclable materials. However, manufacturing products potentially cause more impact on the environment. Apart from the same effects mentioned above, the manufacture also consumes a huge amount of materials, water, energy and produce carbon footprint on delivery. Reusing second-hand items is reducing newly manufactured ones. Thus RE:source brings positive impact to the environment.

On the other hand, as for the usage of fundings, apart from supporting the compulsory delivery and storage service, RE: source plan to use the profit to fund the artist who can upcycle the second-hand goods through in the future. This movement maximize the value of used items and avoid the manufacture of the products that serve a similar function. Also, the brand deliver sustainable ideas to a larger audience through a workshop which invites the public to participate in the redesign process.

# 4. Design Methodology

## 4.1 The Storytelling in RE:source - based on SB7 framework

The implement of RE:source storytelling is based on SB7 framework. The project mainly deal with two kind of users: donator and buyer. Since all the selling products are recycled from donation, the narrative of storyline begins from donator, and then switch to buyer. The presentation of donor story goes to the donation guide page, while our-mission page targets at the painpoints of buyers.

After analysising the user problems, RE:source adapt the SB7 framework as followed:

The guide in both user cases acted by the Re: source brand.

**Hero story 1: Donator**
Donator refers to that Chinese student who is about to leave the UK in a hurry.

"Help the environmentalists to donate within 10 minutes. Save your time for something else you enjoy (subtitle)." This slogan pointed out the character of a donator: environmentalist.

The external problem of donator is to deal with a large amount of second-hand households within a limited time. The internal problem is the reluctance to resolve procrastination when facing hard-work with no rewards as well as the conflict of being a caring environmentalist or being a careless person who dumps the load in a landfill.

Therefore the story on related page explained the idea "we hate taking bulky items downstairs and dump them as much as you do." The solution provided by RE:source is free donation collecting service. Step-by-step guide and carefully-desigend form process will simplify the donation register process. As a result, there might be a higher possibility the user take part in donation. As for the reward, Miller(2017) stressed offering a status in return. Thus, donator will get an certification with his memership as a RE: source support and all the detailed contribution he made to the environment. A certification brings up the feeling of rewarded and being affirmed. At the end of the story, the sucess should be depicted with an image shows the character leaving UK without burden.

<br/>

**Hero story 2: Buyer**
In general, the buyer is mainly made up of first year students who just arrived in the UK and are still struggling to get used to the new environment and looking for a way to decorate their new life.<br/>

"Best bargain, reliable prodcuts." The slogan pointed out the price and quality advantage of RE:source products.<br/>

Buyer face the external problem of paying a fortune for furniture that cannot be taken away and being scare to be scammed. In this case, to ease buyer's doubt, RE: source establish 7-day return policy, guarantee on-time delivery and quality of goods. Through closely cooperate with removal company, the reliability of service is guaranteed. As for the internal problem, the buyer is looking for a brand that they could rely on. Re: source is set to be considerate like a senior to the new students. "We know a bus trip to IKEA with tons of household items back is a hassle. Why not enjoy the bargain online? All stuff here is still good as new and directly delivered to your doorstep. " Accordingly, the website will lead the buyer through the purchasing process through caring micro-content.

## 4.2 RE: source user Experience design

RE: source is designed to achieve delight and satisfaction. The ideal performance requires to meet Aaron's user needs.

(1) Functional: RE: source help donators to fill in the form as quick and easy as possible and provides the buyer with the list and filter for second-hand products.

(3) Reliable: RE: source responds consistently and is effective in finding the desired stuff and helping user finish the tasks.

## 4.3 User Experience Evaluation

In order to find out the the effect of storytelling on the e-commerce brand, the research built a version without storytelling and a version with storytelling. The user experience on both versions are tested and analysised with user experience questionnaire (UEQ). UEQ includes 26 items that are grouped into six scales: Attractiveness, perspicuity, efficiency, dependability, stimulation and novelty.(Schrepp et al, 2017)
