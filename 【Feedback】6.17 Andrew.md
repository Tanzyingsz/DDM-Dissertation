The topic right now is not “strong” enough. Quite established area. OK to do, but have to find a own direction of argument.
People all know trust in brand is important.

Why focus on Chinese UK students?
Is it because they have problem with buying and using the second hand goods.

Only talk about Wecaht is not enough.
Have to analysis WHY the other platforms are not commonly used. What are the reasons? Why does the Chinese UK student think those platforms are not good enough for them to use?

**Have to prove there is interest among Chinese UK student in this project to begin with.**

free cycle, amazon marketplace, meadow share -- People are doing second hand exchange all the time already.

The risk of talking about "trust"
The website can be trustworthy, but the user just have no interest in the offers on the website.

**Question about the project:**
Are you recreacting a website that is commonly used/succeed among UK students for the Chinese students?
