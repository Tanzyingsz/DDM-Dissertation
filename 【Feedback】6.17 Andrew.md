The topic **Which web design attributes are best for instilling trust in online sustainable brands?** right now is not “strong” enough. Quite established area. OK to do, but have to find a own direction of argument.
People all know trust in brand is important.

**Why focus on Chinese UK students?**
Is it because they have problem with buying and using the second hand goods?

**Only talk about Wecaht is not enough.**
Wechat is not a sceond-hand donating shopping experience.
You have to analysis and critique other business that is doing the same thing. e.g. freecycle
Have to analysis WHY the other platforms are not commonly used. What are the reasons? Why does the Chinese UK student think those platforms are not good enough for them to use?
How was their experience, what do they like about the platfrom, what do they not like about the platform? And somethimes the shop or person on the platform is the root problem of trust.

**Have to prove there is interest among Chinese UK student in this project to begin with.**

free cycle, amazon marketplace, meadow share -- People are doing second hand exchange all the time already.

**The risk of talking about "trust"**
The website can be trustworthy, but the user just have no interest in the offers on the website. Is that the reason why wechat does not work?

**The business**
To build the business model, you have to figure out what the UK chinese student do not trust in second-hand sustainbility on platform like gumtree or ebay?
e.g. Previous student research found out that some Chinese are reluctant to buy second hand cloth because they are afraid somebody had died in them/not clean/infections.

**Design attributes are too superfical, the underlying question is actually what this website is for, what people want, and this website is going to drive them to your goal.**
->Logic shold be: what is this website for->why people want to use it->how to make a engaging experience

**The design of the website has to reflect the trust issues.**
refund, reliable, guarantee,resonable price -> incorporat them in the design of the website. You are building a model of a specific business.

**Question about the project:**
Are you recreacting a website that is commonly used/succeed among UK students for the Chinese students?

Need some statistics and evidence on the should be recycled but went to landfill rubbish.

--If the theme switch back to storytelling
define a story in your way, how do you show story with images, transition etc.
