# **Why and how digital storytelling optimizes the user experience on website**

# **- The case of RE:source, a sustainbale second-hand donation and shopping brand**

# **ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS**

# **ABSTRACT**

# **1.INTRODUCTION**

The main objective of this project is to explore the reason why storytelling optimizes user experience on an e-commerce website and how storytelling achieves that. The dissertation first draws the insights of digital storytelling from other researchers together, then explain how the theories work through case studies. After the general discussion comes the detail introduction to the sustainability ideas and structure design of RE: source. By incorporating the useful findings in research and studies, the RE:source website is built. Finally, …interviews.

The output of this dissertation is a fully functional second-hand donation and shopping website. The focus of the dissertation is digital storytelling which is largely shown on front-end. Hence, the back-end shopping functions like add-to-cart, payment APIs and product management system are made through Webflow, a website building a hosting service. Nevertheless, none template used. All front-end parts are built from sketch.

The project is currently hosted under the domain[ https://re-source.live.](https://re-source.live.)

# **2.LITERATURE REVIEW**

## 2.1 Storytelling

### 2.1.1 Start From The Origin: What Is Storytelling?

To understand digital storytelling, we should first start from the very basic - story. A story contains a series of information that makes up the narrative. In history, various definitions are set for the story. "Narratives are stories", through storytelling, one can understand his own life better (Shankar et al, 2001). Stories create the experience that fulfils the listener's desire for searching for emotions (Fournier, 1998). "Human memory is story-based"(Schank, 1999) Human tend to store and retrieve information as stories. Therefore, people react to the information that is already a story faster and easier and even experience pleasure in the process (Holt, 2013).

The approach to bring the story to life is storytelling. Storytelling has been widely used because it affects how people think and act. On one hand, science backup the crucial role of storytelling - the human brain is hardwired for stories. Neuroeconomist Zak discovered story will increase the release of neurochemical oxytocin, the so-called "love hormone" and dopamine which contribute a long-lasting and more accurate memory (Zak, 2013). Besides, human tend to mirror their experience to the storyteller's. Hence, after listening to the story, the customer will perform a higher level of empathy. On the other hand, the voice of the public supports the importance of storytelling. In the 2017 report, storytelling was rated the most effective marketing tactics among 62% of B2B marketers. The number of B2C storytelling supporter was even higher (The Science of Storytelling (Infographic), 2017). It is said that people are 22 times more likely to memorize a fact when they are presented in the form of a story (Ochs and Capps, 2009).

### 2.1.2 Storytelling Structure

A systematic framework helps to structure a story for better user experience. Previous studies proposed frameworks like the persona-based model (Herskovitz and Crystal,2010), the Hero’s Journey story framework (Campbell, 2008), story brand 7-Part framework (SB7 framework) (Miller, 2017) etc. Among which Miller's framework is the most comprehensive and easy to process for customers. It emphasizes the influence of user instead of bragging about the importance of the storyteller - usually the brand who runs the website - itself. Therefore, this project plan to adapt Miller's work into practice. The SB7 framework proposes a 7-plot-points genuine story formula:

(1) **A character** especially refers to a hero acted by the reader. In this case, a story does not necessarily have an avatar to work.

(2) **A problem to solve**. If the character stays in forever peace, the story cannot move on. Hence, there is usually a villain to push forward the plot. What comes with a villain is a problem that messes up with the character.

(3) **A guide**. The one who helps the hero to conquer all problems and win. The brand itself acts as the guidance of the hero.

(4)** A plan **that takes away consumer's confusion.

(5) **Call to action**, challenge the character to take an actual step that brings them from challenge back to a peaceful life.

(6) **A vision of the tragic ending** that warns the customer what might happen if they do not follow the lead of this brand.

(7) **The glorious success **illustrates the bright future of trusting this brand.

To illustrate how this story framework works, Let's take the first _Hunger Game_ movie as an example: Katniss Everdeen has to survive in a death tournament to save her home in District 12. She was mentored by the liquor-loving ex-tournament-winner Haymitch. Haymitch helped her planed and endear the public for supports which increased her chance of survival. Simply put, this SB7 framework works in many circumstances and positively engage the audience. As a result, the storyline of RE:source project was largely based on SB7 framework, with two user cases considered, the buyer and the donor.

## 2.2 Digital Storytelling

### 2.2.1 What is digital storytelling

The concept of digital storytelling first came up in the 1990s when the Center for Digital Storytelling began to hold workshop that engage the audience who are willing to share their personal story (StoryCenter, 2005). Later on, as the internet developed, many have made an attempt to define digital storytelling(Meadows, 2003; Signes,2010; Alexander,2017). Nevertheless, they all coincide in considering digital storytelling as a way to explain traditional storytelling through a multimedia way which involves audio, video, images, animations and so on. However, the working definition in this study define digital storytelling as an interactive and engaging technology that tell stories in a multimedia way.

The key features of digital storytelling in this dissertation are stated as followed:

**Digital storytelling is web-based. **The concept of "digital" covers a wider range of technique and format. In a practical environment, ground-breaking works like interactive TV series "Black Mirror: Bandersnatch" and immersive game "Detroit: Become Human" had greatly expanded the border of digital storytelling form. However, to narrow the concept, the format of digital storytelling used in this dissertation covers only the web-based narratives, namely website. Nevertheless, a website does reduce the usage of multiple digital materials. Photographs, motion graphics, videos and even Google map all counts when needed (Alexander,2017).

**Digital storytelling is interactive. **The interactivity is actually the greatest difference between classic storytelling and digital storytelling(Handler Miller,2008). Since digital storytelling is web-based, human-computer interaction is included. In this case, the interactive nature of digital storytelling directly switch the user identity from an "audience" to a "participant." Unlike traditional media, such as books and movies, where information act as a one-way flow, user's activity will influence the content on digital storytelling medium. For example, when interacting with a digital storytelling website, users are expecting the system to provide feedback as soon as they input or change the parameters on page.【举例】

**Digital storytelling covers various types. **Digital storytelling could be applied to various genres. Robin(2005) dedicated 3 main categories for digital storytelling: 1) personal narratives - a series of important incidents of one's personal life 2) historical documentaries – narratives about the historical events that help to form a deeper understanding of the past and 3) stories for informing or instructing user about a certain concept. 【举例】

### 2.2.2 Why Digital Storytelling optimizes User Experience?

#### **Digital storytelling reduce noise on web**

In modern websites, the information explosion feeds people with way too much noise (Miller, 2017). Noise refers to the irrelevant information to the story that distracts user attention. Luckily, storytelling is a powerful approach to create music out of noise, since it emphasizes the main ideas and weakens irrelevant information. Well-choreographed story act like a map that leads the customer all the way through the product and services provided. In this case, the customer does not have to overload their mental capacity and guide them towards the desired actions.

#### **Digital storytelling enhances engagement**

Alexander (2017) defined engagement as the first and foremost noticeable feature of digital storytelling. The core of engagement lies in "meaning". Without a meaning, the none-digital-storytelling is simply a pack of document that is hard to parse or digest. It is a meaning that pull in its viewer or listener. Digital stories are crafted with digital method, in an attempt to engage and interest the audience through the meaning inside. In **_The Significant Object_** project, 200 near-worthless items on the digital platform eBay was hardly visited at the beginning. But after a digital story attached to each of them, these items sold out overnight with their value significantly rose for over 1000 times (a ＄ 0.99 horse toy sold at ＄ 62.95 ). The digital storytelling engaged the customers and even persuaded them to pay for the items.

#### **Digital storytelling brings comprehension/entertainment**

### 2.2.3 How Digital Storytelling On A Website Works? The Secret Formula

**How to build an enjoyable experience? The usage of colour**

Colour has a significant effect on digital storytelling experience. Colour contributes to the user experience in clarifying information through the visual hierarchy.

Visual hierarchy refers to the arrangement of element importance level. By experimenting with saturation, shade and tint of a different hue, the priority of elements can be adjusted accordingly(Brian, 2019). A clear visual hierarchy can help the user to comprehend website story content easier and guide their attention. In terms of comprehension, studies have shown that compared to grayscale material online, coloured content increases comprehension by an astonishing 75%. And Text with highlight colour also works 14% better than bold text(Xerox, 2017). In terms of attention guidance, it has been proved that content with higher colour saturation appears larger to eyes and command more attention (Hagtvedt and Brasel, 2017).

**How to show the influence? The power of data**

People are drawn to numbers. In the world full of uncertainty and scam, a static firm number offer the user a sense of reliability and add a counterweight to digital storytelling (Damodaran, 2017). Data in storytelling can convey information more vividly. For example, in the RE:source campaign that persuades people the importance of sustainability, the hard-hitting stats of how severe the environment has been damaged is more persuasive than a pure descriptive paragraph."Every person in the UK produce 409kg waste annually which is roughly the weight of 4 giant pandas" is better than "There are many wastes in the UK". People will get a quantitative sense of the waste and also feels the animal they cherished get hurt by their careless activity.

**How to highlight the points? Typography and motion graphics help**

Studies pointed out that web users tend to scan web pages than reading word by word (Morkes and Nielsen, 1997) Therefore a clear visual hierarchy and attention-grabbing design of the key story part becomes crucial. Typography and motion graphics together makes the scanning experience easier and more understandable.

Typography act as one of the core building blocks for visual hierarchy. A proper text treatment will measurably affect user productivity and increase satisfaction in user experience(Boulton, 2009). Generally, the typographical hierarchy deal with contrast. It highlights the content that matters to the user most. Designers commonly create contrast between headings and body text through the adjustment of font size, weight, typeface and the whitespace in between letters. Since contrast contains the meaning of "difference", it is crucial to set distinct roles to fonts and their variants. And the role should be consistent within a website for united user experience.

Motion graphics is an advanced version of visual design that combines animation and static images together. They act as visual aids of text content. The most commonly seen form is short footage that aims to help break down the complex or abstract story. While the human brain already processes visual stimuli 60,000 times faster than text(3M Visual Systems Division, 2018), we are also more sensitive to moving objects(Beverley and Regan, 1980). That is to say, motion graphics not only improve the user interpretation speed on the story but capture their attention at the same time. What's more And the role of motion graphics actually exceed a simple information deliverer: they also direct the user sight along a certain direction or indicate the hierarchy.

**How to increase user engagement? Gamify the experience**

Researchers have considered gamification as a critical role in increasing the engagement in digital storytelling website due to its interactivity and its ability to bring joy and fun(Reeves and Read, 2009; Choe et. al, 2011). Gamification refers to the process that exerts game mechanics into a non-game environment. They are built to facilitate some desired behaviour and increase the engagement rate. (Huotari and Hamari, 2011) By using game-like elements in storytelling, the normal users are motivated as a "player" to get involved in the overall experience and do expected actions. For example, the progress bar in LinkedIn profile motivates the user to fill in more personal information. Other designs like badges, onboarding journey and time constraints are all considered as gamification(Tubik Studio, 2017). Gamification makes a digital story more fun to navigate and Tasks and rewards it set stimuli people's curiosity and excitement. Consequently, people will spend more time on a website and immerse in the story more.

## 2.3 UI/UX Case Studies: Digital Storytelling On E-commerce Websites

### 2.3.1 Etsy - The vibrant global marketplace

Etsy introduces digital storytelling to convey user its value and build up enjoyable user experience.

At the end of the Etsy main page, there is a hyperlink that leads to "our wonderfully weird story" which is already a humorous description. Within the link is a text-heavy but clean "About" page (https://www.etsy.com/uk/about). In regards to the visual structure, the large-scale text takes up half of the space while motion graphics with a takes up the rest. All the keywords in the paragraph are highlighted with an underline, clicking any of them will reveal a hidden section of explanatory motion graphic. The low saturation colour scheme is comforting and consistent. Even though the overall tone of copyright is rather serious, the hand-drawing style motion graphics and Serif fonts bring a vintage and vibrant feeling to the user.

<p id="gdcalert6" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image6.jpg). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert7">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>

![alt_text](images/image6.jpg "image_tooltip")

[Figure: Screenshot of Etsy "ABOUT" page - the usage of motion graphics and data]

From the interaction perspective, the clickable keywords bring user entertainment because the hidden sections bring a bit of surprise excitement. Also, the persuasive data shown to act as powerful evidence of how to influence Etsy is and affects the user's emotion, from questioning to trusting. According to "Bandwagon effect", the user is more willing to be part of the community or take action when they see a large number of people had already done the same (Leibenstein, 1950). Also, the cat who poke out whenever the slider is clicked makes the interaction more fun.

![alt_text](images/image7.jpg "image_tooltip")

[Figure: Screenshot of Etsy slider with cat]

After the user scrolls down the page, they will come to the darker section with a call-to-action button embedded. The visual cues of this part stand out thanks to the large area of a dark blue background. While scrolling this part, the motion graphics on the right-hand side change according to the content, just like a step guide that informs the users where they are. The animation expresses the process more intuitively than pure text. It helps to ease the anxiety of getting lost in pages and keep users on the page. Also, this section follows "the rule of odds" - an odd number of objects in an image is more interesting and appealing compare to even number objects (Zhang and Multiexposure, 2012). The easy-to-follow steps show the user how to be a seller or buyer and get access to help.

### 2.3.2 Dopper - The persuasive reusable bottle story

Dopper built an extremely immersive digital storytelling experience. ([https://dopper.com/our-mission)](https://dopper.com/our-mission)) Generally, the Dopper story follows the SB7 storytelling framework and prove that the framework works.

Following the description in 2.1.3 section, the user who read through the page is the hero while Dopper acts as the guide.

Firstly, Dopper places a bait and establish an undersea theme through its sea-like 3D environment and text description. The beginning part plants a question in potential customers’ mind - "What did single-use plastic do to our crystal clear water? Just as Andrew Stanton (2012), the world-famous film director once said in his TED: "Don't give them (the audience) 4, give them 2+2." Leave the task of figuring out what is going on to the reader. " Out of curiosity, the customer will continue to scroll down the page and linger longer. As for the sea-like environment setting, the scroll-down interaction is a clever metaphor of diving into the sea - as user browsing through the page, the background change from above sea level to underwater. Meanwhile, the colour gets darker just like the dim light in the deep sea.

<p id="gdcalert9" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image9.jpg). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert10">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>

![alt_text](images/image9.jpg "image_tooltip")

[Figure: the beginning scene and bait of Dopper]

Then large scaring states of plastic waste jump into the page, while disgusting tiny plastic pieces floating in the background. These part throw out the environmental problem that the user and Dopper will solve together and is also the vision of tragic ending if the user refuses Dopper bottles. During this section, users might experience a certain level of shock, regret and will probably expect to find a way out in the rest content.

<p id="gdcalert10" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image10.jpg). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert11">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>

![alt_text](images/image10.jpg "image_tooltip")

[Figure: Usage of stats in Dopper]

Thankfully, Dopper immediately presents its product as a solution to the terrifying situation. The full-angle presentation of water bottle along with copyright sentences targeted to the previous problems. Meanwhile, the background lights up and makes the scrolling experience more relaxed.

Furthermore, Dopper emphasizes its mission and impact by listing its actions and educational programs. Interestingly, the rule of odds appears once again. The slowly increasing number of plastic waste reduction vividly express the idea that Dopper is continuously making its contribution. Most importantly, the page introduces interaction into its process - when users slide the range bar, they will be able to see the impact they will have on the environment with buying Dopper product. "Kudos for reading this long story" shows the considerate attitude of the brand and bring the customer emotionally closer. This part illustrates the bright and meaningful future where the user will contribute to the greater good. Consequently, the impulse to purchasing a Dopper bottle is increased.

Finally, the button to the shopping section floats up, waiting for the user activity. "Our oceans will thank you." and "contribute to these cool things" increase the user proud and esteem even more. By this point, there is a high possibility the user might pursue to discover more in the shop. The whole cycle of digital storytelling ends thoroughly.

### 2.3.3 Analysis of UI/UX case studies

Comparing the two digital storytelling cases, both create a straightforward storytelling user experience and pass the information about their value and mission in a clean and artistic way. But the Dopper story is even more playful, engaging and persuasive.

In terms of similarities, firstly, they both had a clear visual hierarchy and emphasize the call-to-action part with a deeper and larger area of colour. Secondly, They heavily relied on statistics to convey the user their value and impact. Thirdly, Etsy used more informative motion-graphics to help the user understand the content while Dopper reaches the same goal with fewer motion graphics but more 3D transition and parallax effects.

When it comes to difference, Dopper creates a more thorough storyline with full undersea background setting and conflict between the user goal of protecting the environment and one-time-use bottles. Etsy focuses more on descriptive paragraph of their solutions and reactions to user needs. Besides, the interactive elements like the range slider in Dopper visualize the impact of the user which makes the user relate to the situation more and have a higher level of engagement. Whatsmore, the hidden section in Etsy brings surprise and enjoyment to the user.

# **3. DOUBLE DIAMOND MODEL AND RE:SOURCE**

The design thinking model adopted by RE:source is called “The Double Diamond Design”. The Double Diamond design model was first announced by the British Design Council early in 2015【引用】. It is a nonlinear design process including four diverging and converging phases: discover, define, develop and deliver. Designers are encouraged to jump back and forth during the design process to either solve the problem or improve the existed solution plan. The aim of this model is to guide the designer on their way to create solutions to problems.

[Figure: Double diamond process]

Based on the concept Double Diamond design model, RE:source carried out its design and modified the some details when needed.

## 3.1 Discover

As the first stage of the Double Diamond Design process, this stage is used to observe the problem and established the initial questions.

### 3.1.1 Background: **The dilemma of UK Chinese student**

When Chinese student first land in the UK, they usually have to hurry to buy home accessories like beddings to get past the first several days. Exhausted and filled with the scare facing the whole new environment alone, freshmen are experiencing great stress. Besides, the price of new items might also become an unnecessary financial burden - the lower price second-hand items could serve the same function perfectly well.

It is a common approach for the about-to-leave student to find new-coming students to take over pre-loved belongings. However, due to the 2020 pandemic, many students are forced to leave the UK earlier. The start of the new semester is also delayed which means less student will arrive in the UK soon. In this case, there is a high possibility that the second-hand goods will go to the trash if nobody takes care of them. However, stuff like mattress or electric kettle normally just had been used for a year, which is way far from their designed period of use. Therefore, loads items with value are abandoned, turned into unnecessary waste and pollution.

### 3.1.2 Background: Chinese second-hand market

To know the target audience better, we should first investigate the environment they come from.

The secondhand market in China is at its nascent but growing dramatically. Statistics show the Chinese recommerce market had reached \$71.1 billion in 2017, made up around 0.6% of the total GDP in 2017 and is predicted to double by 2020 (Wang, 2019). However, compared to the large scale secondhand market in some western country, the Chinese market still has loads of room for improvement. For example, the total value of listed goods on Blocket, the largest Sweden online second-hand platform, corresponded to 11% of Swedish GDP (CASI, 2020).

There are several reasons why Chinese secondhand market is limited.

From a cultural perspective, some people has aversion about second-hand items because superstitions assume used stuff bring misfortune from their previous owner. The uncertainty about how the item was abandoned scare some people off (The Jakarta Post, 2019). For example, a car could be resold because it had gone through accidents. It is believed that the new owner might have to deal with the bad luck brought by this car. Besides, some simply think it is degrading to use unwanted items because only the poor pick what is left from others (Hurwitz, 2014).

From a cognitive aspect, most charity shops are run by the government who seldom promote these charity services. The shortage of systematic marketing plan also causes trouble to the donate-selling business. Most importantly, the items in these shops are not included in the tax exemption policy (Yanjie, 2016). Therefore the price of the second-hand products is close to the market price, which is hardly attractive to the public. It is reported that that the price in some charity shop is even higher than the normal price - the extra fee is explained as the donation to charity (Beijing morning post, 2014).

From an infrastructure perspective, the broken service chain has to take responsibility for the second-hand recycling dilemma. Recently there are more recycle box installed within the community. However, when the box is filled, nobody bothers to deliver them to the company in charge (kknews, 2018). Items packed in the box get rotten and smelly. In this case, people would rather directly dump their used stuff instead of donation.

As for the online second-hand platforms, the concern mentioned most from the Chinese secondhand buyer is the reliability of the seller, followed by the questionable hygiene of second-hand products. Sometimes customers receive the product that is not compatible with the images shown online (CBNData, 2019).

In conclusion, a higher quality of product and the avoidance of scammer leads to a better online second-hand shopping experience.

### 3.1.3 Brief competitor research

【微信：可信度高，距离近不用管运输，不用注册登录。但是难以找到想要的东西，也没有平台保证质量和售后。英国平台，有平台质量保证但是设计杂乱，品类太多，售后不足】

According to the brief questionnaire among 75 Chinese second-hand buyers (Appendix 3), WeChat, the largest social media in China, turns out to be the No.1 channel Chinese students use for idle goods transaction in the UK. Students post their second-hand items to Wechat group in the form of text or images. The good point is that, students are purchasing stuff from the acquaintance: either those who live in the same accommodation or from the same university. Thus, transactions on Wechat means 1) no need to worry about delivery since most buyers are usually within walking distance; 2) Communication between the seller and buyer could be much more timely and efficient due to the social nature of Wechat. 3) No complicated register process stand in the way. However, as a messaging tool, WeChat provides a clunky, unorganised, and an uninformative shopping experience that requires users to tediously scroll through the group’s chat history, not knowing whether they will ﬁnd their desired item or whether the item is available. Most importantly, the platform does not guarantee for the lost of transaction. When a user is deceived, it is hard to chase the money back.

eBay and Gumtree are also mentioned as commonly used second-hand web applications. No doubt that these two global platforms provides a more comprehensive category list and systematic services like return and refund policy. Nevertheless, the advertisements on both site distract users frequently. The poorly structured pages make many noises and hard to find the information needed. Not mentioning Gumtree seems to put its hand on everything ， its categories cover jobs, financial services and even pet adoption. It is hard to figure out what would the target user of Gumtree would be like. Furthermore, according to open online reviews, these two platforms got many complaints about "the low quality of products, being scammed and the lake of customer service" (Trustpilot, 2020).

【破除迷信，保证供应链，售后完备，设计合理】

### 3.1.4 Three Major queries

Based on the above research, three major queries are raised:

1. How to provide a reliable service chain?
2. How to change the mindset of the user to accept buying second-hand items?
3. How to make a considerate design easy to navigate with?

## 3.2 Define - Project Brief

To synthesise the research, one should summarize raw findings and seek for insights based on the available materials.

### 3.2.1 Overview

RE: source is a business-to-consumer(B2C) sustainable second-hand online marketplace serving donors and buys, outbound senior Chinese students, inbound Chinese students who are starting their education in the UK. RE:source collect second-hand items from donor and resell them to the buyers. The ultimate goal of RE:source is to actively shape the perspectives mindset of environmental awareness and sustainability of the Chinese studying in the UK through digital storytelling.

### 3.2.2 The Mode

RE:source fill the time gap of second-hand goods transportation between the two bodies of the student: freshmen and senior students.RE:source first collect donation from the leaving senior students through delivery. The donation information like the address of the donor and estimation on the size of total donation is from donation form submitted on RE:source website. Also, the donor will be awarded with a printed certificate with the detailed status of how many resources the donor they have saved. There are 3 possible destinations for the donated items: 1）become the material to be redesigned by RE:source product designers; 2) Act as the educational material for the workshop that teaches the public about sustainability. Product designers will invite the audience to take part in some simple redesign task. 3) Hit the shelves in the RE:source online store and waiting to serve the next wave of students.

Currently, the benefits earned by RE:source mainly maintain the daily operations: the delivery and warehouse fee and hosting the online shop. In the near future, the benefits will also be used to fund the artist who is able to redesign the second-hand goods. The rest will go to charity.

### 3.2.3 Target Users

The UK Chinese student secondhand market might have a bright future. The number of Chinese international student rank first in the 2017-2018 UK higher education(UKCISA, 2019). Almost 70% of the student enrolling in the UK education age under 25, which happens to be the most open age group to the idea of a circular economy, (CBNData, 2019), the material loop concept of eliminating waste and realizing the full potential of products. Therefore, the RE: source platform target at Chinese UK student who has a huge potential to embrace the sustainable lifestyle.

The target user is divided into two types, donor and buyer. Donor refers to the student who tries to relieve second-hand burdens as soon as possible before leaving the UK. Buyers are the student who is about to begin their study in the UK or had just arrived for the new semester.

### 3.2.4 The Offering

RE:source aims to provide reliable service and optimizes the user experience through an artistic but functional website which lays stress on digital storytelling.

RE:source raise the following solution for the three major queries 3.1.4:

**Reliable Service**

In order to deal with the scam issue on second-hand platform, RE:source solve the root of the problem through choosing the path of B2C instead of P2P (Peer to peer). Since RE:source take responsibility for checking the quality and usability of used items and provide genuine information on its website, the user no longer has to worry about the reliability of products. What is more, the price is kept in an acceptable range as well. Specifically, considering the lack of British bank card Furthermore, timely customer service is provided through email. Customer can always get the support they need.

**Help the user to accept second-hand items**

Digital storytelling plays a big part in this mission. Firstly, The overall cheerful colour and tone of voice communicate the idea that second-hand items are neither nasty nor unlucky. Secondly, the visualized number of the saving energy immediately provide positive awarding feedback to the user and make them feel “I am contributing to the bigger picture!” Finally, Instead of being the symbol of bad luck, second-hand items are packed inside the “lucky dip” which carries the idea of “passing luck to its new owner”.

<p id="gdcalert15" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image15.jpg). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert16">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>

![alt_text](images/image15.jpg "image_tooltip")

[ Figure: Visualized number of the saving energy]

**Clean design and simplified process**

In the matter of shopping, no login is required on RE:source. All purchase information will be sent to the user e-mail. Therefore user do not have to go through the time-consuming register process and worrying about forgetting the password. Plus, unlike Gumtree who try to contain everything, the category on RE:source is limited to two specific range: lucky dip and bulky items. While small size second-hand items are packed into the lucky dip, large scale items whose dimension matters could be purchased individually.

[Figure: Two category of RE:source shop]

With regard to the donation process, RE:source first build up a step-by-step guide to simplify the donation collection reservation with a new estimation method: estimate through the size of the shipping box.

### 3.2.5 Project Value

RE:source is a sustainable and influential project. It not only helps to protect the environment and prevent unnecessary pollution by selling second-hand goods to those in need but also use digital storytelling to pass the public the value of sustainability.

Reuse and redesign second-hand items affect nature significantly. Throwing reusable items away already leads to extra landfill, water pollution and waste on recyclable materials. Not mentioning the fact that manufacturing new products potentially cause even more waste. More importantly, the newly manufactured ones also consume a huge amount of materials, water, energy and produce carbon footprint on delivery.【reference】Resign pre-owned items maximize their value and avoid manufacturing new products that serve a similar function. For example, the cushion made by abandoned fabric can work equally well as the new.

In terms of social impact, the RE:source website open up a window to the public. Students can access the website, read through the story and realize how their mindless movements of throwing reusable items can affect the environment. They can also step into a sustainable lifestyle through RE:source, no matter they choose to donate or purchase pre-owned items, any tiny act will contribute to the larger picture. The future plan of holding public workshops will further deliver sustainable ideas to a larger audience through the workshop which invites the public to participate in the redesign process.

In conclusion, RE: source brings positive impact to both environment and the society.

## 3.3 Develop - Prototype Iterations

This stage marks the actual start of finding the solutions. It requires prototype and continuous upgrading on the design. The RE:source development started with the text version of the story. Then illustrations are designed accordingly.

### 3.3.1 Style guide

To maintain a consistent visual style, logo guidelines, colour palette and typography are the first to be settled. The main font is Karla, “a grotesque sans-serif typeface”(Pinhorn, 2020).

[Figure: Design System]

The RE:source logo had gone through several rounds of adjustment.

[Figure: RE:source database setting]

#### The digital storytelling

The goal of the story presented on RE:source is to convince the potential donor and buyer that they can make a difference to the environment by answering the call for action on RE:source website.

The story is mainly divided into 4 sections: 1) the bait and background. 2) RE:source system description 3) promise 4) our achievement. Each of the section is decorated with their main colour to make them easy to distinguish from each other. The story logic is to first let the donor and buyer to get a grasp of how the second-hand items affect the nature, then help them understand the workflow and impact of RE: source, lastly agree with RE:source value and willing to take action.

## 3.4 Deliver - Development on Webflow

The last stage is to launch and test the final product.

Given the dissertation time constraint, RE:source chose Webflow as its development tool. Since Webflow's e-commerce system takes care of the backend data transmission, the author could purely focus on the story content, visual design and interactions. In addition, due to lockdown, the author had no access to IOS system. Consequently, the website was only tested on Chrome.

**Gamification: flipping cards**

Instead of illustrating the lucky dip in a box-like or bag-like stereotype, the card-like design is inspired by tarot card. As the tool to tell fortune, the tarot card is usually linked to the keyword "mysterious". The flipping card process is full of uncertainty, just like the nature of a lucky dip. Consequently, this gamification brings user excitement of finding out the hidden list on the back of card.

[Figure: Flipping card versions]

Here "the rule of odds" is proved to be right. At first, there were 8 cards on the page. Users stop scrolling and lose the chance to see the following section. Because they saw the last two cards and "think the page ends here." After making to card number to 9, users no longer stop before the true ending comes.

# **4. CONCLUSION**

## 4.1 Evaluation of RE:source

### 4.1.1 Method

To elicit information about how the user experience on the RE:source storytelling goes, 3 semi-structured interviews were carried out. Questions were focused on the user experience regarding the usability of the website, the emotional reaction towards the story and the overall feeling on engagement【加一个理论引用 e.g. Measuring storytelling Engagement】.

### 4.1.2 Participants and Procedure

3 students participated in this study. All of them are Chinese students currently studying or about to study in the UK. Every interviewee has no previous interaction with the website. This is to make sure the result is purely based on their first impression on the project. Participants were first asked to finish 2 simple tasks : 1.Get to the last step of the donation process, the donation form 2.Get to the payment page of one product. Then they free to explore the "our-mission" storytelling page. After browsing through the whole website, the interview is conducted. All interviews were recorded.

### 4.1.3 Results

The interviews reveals that all users could finish the donation and shopping task relatively easily. "Quite straightforward" as they described. Even though "Our-mission" tab is usually neglected at the beginning, after the interviewer guide the user to get into the page, their attitudes towards the website and sustainability change significantly in a positive way.

【more results】

### 4.2 Discussion and Future Development

The study also indicates that… 【content】

Based on the feedback from interviews, the future version of RE:source might need a English to Chinese translation function, to help the target user navigate with the website. To achieve a deeper level of interactivity, social media could be introduced into the system. For example, build up blog system to hold the newest process of RE:source and allow people to contribute their own stories with RE:source through a comment or sharing the content to other social media.
