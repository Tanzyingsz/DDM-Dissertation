I conducted a small range of open-ended Survey online survey that involved 12 anonymous Chinese student studying in UK. The aim of this survey is to find out what factors do Chinese student care most about a website that explain its brand well.

Each student got 4 random websites from the 10 webstie list to test. Additionally, 2 students among the 12 were asked to comment on one more website. In the end, every website got 5 feedbacks.

There are 3 questions for each website. Students were asked to note down the advantage and disadvantage of the given websites. Thees first 2 questions are totally open, not limited to UI or Ux area. In this case, I can get a more general idea of peer's taste. The third question is "How likely are you to recommend this website to your friend?" for a more quantifiable result.

Why these 10 websites are selected out of over 200 award winning canidates and the conclusion of testing result of the survey are listed as followed (5 feedbacks on each website, numbers in brackets indicate number of feedback that mentioned similar feature):

  -In the "about us" page, the rolling list on the bottom keeps distracting user. And the reasons provided in this page need some icon to explain themselves better(1/5)

**REMARK:**

The effect of the colour changing part conflicts. Although some find it interesting and creative, others regard it as a "noise". More tests on this part are needed to find out more about people's reaction to it.

**5. KUA Coffee**
https://kuacoffee.co/

Not a website with fancy animations, but the simple interaction that affects the statistcs is persuasive.(Slide the bar of"How many coffees do you have a day?" result in the change on the land you save) Could be regarded as a control group example compared to the rest of the candidates rich in animations.

**6. Adventure Awaits...**
https://www.defeatboco.com/

**REASON FOR SELECTION:**
An educational website theme at UX design. The whole story is a hero story where the user act as hero and finally get to success. There are barriers and darkness in the way. The brand guide the user walking through the whole experience.(Good example of story branding) The story use a strong metaphor of describing the conflicting opinions as "beasts" that the customer have to fight with.

**ADVANTAGE:**

- easy to scroll back and forth if some messages are missing （3/5）
- The slight gamification light up the whole game. "The final short test after each scene helps the user to understand the content better. And it is considerate that even if you choose the wrong answer, you do not have to start from the beginning, just keep making choice until you get it right. No pressure. The life bar above the monster head making the process more like a game".（3/5）
- Large font size is considerate (2/5)
- metaphor of describing conflicts as monsters are quite clever（2/5）

- "The website adventure style is better for a travel angency."(1/5)
- Scrolling too fast will miss some interaction, better slow down a bit when it comes to interactions(1/5)
- "Sometimes might miss some point in the story, which cause a bit difficulty in answering questions. Will be better if there are some highlight of knowledge point during the experience"(1/5)
- sound effect is not loud enough that it almost get ignored (1/5)
- description fonts are too small to read (2/5)

**REMARK:**
How often should a call to action message appears? It has to appear for certain times so that customer will not miss the message. But not too frequent enough to be annoying.

The visual design of the hints should not cause too many misunderstanding. For example, a button better look like a button so user knows he can click it.

Sometimes the settings of user's device might not be ideal. In this case, some complains the sound of the website is not loud enough - the developer should test everything before publish and make sure the default settings are sutiable for most of the customers.

**7. Zenly**
https://zen.ly/

**REASON FOR SELECTION:**
A product propaganda page with well-designed 3D environemnts.Overall still a scorlling experience, with several extra click involved. Specifically, the website uses sound effect and continous hover effect to help building a cheerful brand image.

- Some paragraphs are not recognizable from the background (1/5)

**REMARK:**
When there is a huge question mark in consumer's head - in this case, about the privacy security, provide the solution in page and make it easy to be seen. At the end of scrolling the story, there is a link says "Zenly is good for you" with the security guarantee inside. But the slogan did not made its goal crystal clear. Directly says "Zenly is safe for you, want to know why?" might be a better choice.

The judge on colour is rather subjective and change according to the personal emotion of users. Therefore a scientific colour scheme that express the right brand emotion is necessary.

**10. Build Securely**
https://safe.page/buildsecurely/

**REASON FOR SELECTION:**
A product selling page that has a distinct control from the usual "scroll-down" experience - the navigation bar is triggered when scrolling up.

**ADVANTAGE**

- the interactions makes the meaning of the paragraphs clear. +1
- functional, persuasive for taking action.
- the story setting in universive is fresh and nteresting +1
- visual design appealing, design style continous +1
- comparison between 2 characters persuasive（2/5）

- Colour calm and comfortable"

**DISADVANTAGE**
"- arrow on the top and the dots on the right serves the same function, not necessary to have them both

- navigation bars are hidden during the storytelling, which is not convenient.
- too many aniamtion without description, they are just connection animation
- Main page to complicated
- actually lack of interaction, and the experience is linear, no skippable. Takes too much effort to the call to action page. User might leave way before the end.
- does not react to mouse wheel scrolling +1
- play and pause button too small and confusing
- would be better to control the animation speed out of own will
- Add caption to the video embedded
- begin at the bottom is really confusing, clicked to the top dot out of instinct and get confused
- ""learn more"" page cannot be seen as a video at first. Need some play/pause icon."

"- The instruction on how to use this page is unclear. Although the logic of scrolling from bottom to top, as the background is launching a rocket, make sense. But it is actually against the user instinct. Extra hint is needed. What is more disappointing - the user have to click the side point to trigger animations, or wait for a section of animation end, and click the top button to continue. Scrolling does not even work in this page...

- The caption in autoplay animation is changing too fast. The play and pause button on the right bottom is WAY TOO SMALL to see.
- It is annoying that every section of the story has to play from its beginning. Feels like looking a video without control bar. Replace the autoplay function with scolling to a certain area trigger a short anmiation might be more reasonable."

#### Comparison

**Scrolling story-telling experience | [Cytora] vs [Build Securely]**

Both websites build up animated story based on hypothetical characters and their goals are selling their services. Although the illustration and animations are all gorgeous, they all fail to actually interact with audience. There is no fault with scroll-trigger-animation setting, but user are not actually changing the direction of the story or even step into the story (e.g. slide and help launch the rocket). Overall the experience are more like reading e-book on a webiste or watching a video that could be controlled frame by frame, which is not as immersive as a slightly gamified experience.

While the former describe the whole decision making process to help user understand the usage of AI in commerical underwriting, the latter compare two characters with and without using Google domain service to stress the importance of keeping website safe. They all help user step into the shoes of related character and follow the process through their eyes.

**Gamified educational experience | [SOS Ciolence Conjugale] vs [WWF Finprint]**
_TBC_

**Good marketing with statistics and reallife story provided|[KUA coffee] vs [Dopper]**
_TBC_

#### CONCLUSION

Here are the takeaways of the 10 websites under surveyed:

**UX**

1. Adequate amount of gamification like multiple choice might engage the audience.
2. The length and the number of stories inside a page has to be reasonable. Too less, user might find the website too boring to browse through. Too much, user will have no patient going through all of the content.
3. Always give user the choice to skip unless it is absolutely necessary to stay in a certain page. User might leave because they cannot immediately jump to the section they want.
4. The proformance of a page matters. When a website burn the laptop hard or not interact fluently, user will get negative impression.

**UI**

1. The landing page needs a clear instruction and a strong slogan.
2. The accessibility of the font should be considered.
3. The style of buttons in the same website should be consistent.
