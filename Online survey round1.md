I conducted a samll range of online survey that involved 12 anonymous Chinese student studying in UK. The aim of this survey is to find out what factors do Chinese student care most about a website that explain its brand well.

Each student got 4 random websites from the 10 webstie list to test. Additionally, 2 students among the 12 were asked to comment on one more website. In the end, every website got 5 feedbacks.

There are 3 questions for each website. Students were asked to note down the advantage and disadvantage of the given websites. Thees first 2 questions are totally open, not limited to UI or Ux area. In this case, I can get a more general idea of peer's taste. The third question is "How likely are you to recommend this website to your friend?" for a more quantifiable result.

Why these 10 websites are selected out of over 200 award winning canidates and the conclusion of testing result of the survey are listed as followed (5 feedbacks on each website, numbers in brackets indicate number of feedback that mentioned similar feature):

**8. The Bottle Is The Message**

**9. WWF Finprint Game**
https://www.wwf-finprint.org/en

**10. Build Securely**
https://safe.page/buildsecurely/

#### Comparison

**Scrolling story-telling experience |** [Cytora] vs [Build Securely]

Both websites build up animated story based on hypothetical characters and their goals are selling their services. Although the illustration and animations are all gorgeous, they all fail to actually interact with audience. There is no fault with scroll-trigger-animation setting, but user are not actually changing the direction of the story or even step into the story (e.g. slide and help launch the rocket). Overall the experience are more like reading e-book on a webiste or watching a video that could be controlled frame by frame, which is not as immersive as a slightly gamified experience.

While the former describe the whole decision making process to help user understand the usage of AI in commerical underwriting, the latter compare two characters with and without using Google domain service to stress the importance of keeping website safe. They all help user step into the shoes of related character and follow the process through their eyes.

**Gamified educational experienc |** [SOS Ciolence Conjugale] vs [WWF Finprint]

#### CONCLUSION

Here are the takeaways of the 10 websites under surveyed:

**UX**

1. Adequate amount of gamification like multiple choice might engage the audience.
2. The length and the number of stories inside a page has to be reasonable. Too less, user might find the website too boring to browse through. Too much, user will have no patient going through all of the content.
3. Always give user the choice to skip unless it is absolutely necessary to stay in a certain page. User might leave because they cannot immediately jump to the section they want.

**UI**

1. The landing page needs a clear instruction and a strong slogan.
2. The accessibility of the font should be considered.
3. The style of buttons in the same website should be consistent.
