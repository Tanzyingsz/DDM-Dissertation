I conducted a small range of open-ended survey online that involved 12 anonymous Chinese student studying in the UK. The aim of this survey is to find out what factors do Chinese student care most about a website that explains its brand well.

Each student got 4 random websites from the 10 website lists to test. Additionally, 2 students among the 12 were asked to comment on one more website. In the end, every website got 5 feedbacks.

There are 3 questions for each website. Students were asked to note down the advantage and disadvantage of the given websites. These first 2 questions are totally open, not limited to UI or Ux area. In this case, I can get a more general idea of a peer's taste. The third question is "How likely are you to recommend this website to your friend?" for a more quantifiable result.

Why these 10 websites are selected out of over 200 award-winning candidates and the conclusion of the testing result of the survey are listed as followed (5 feedbacks on each website, numbers in brackets indicate the number of feedback that mentioned similar feature):

#### RESULT

**2. Swab The World**
https://swabtheworld.com/

**REASON FOR SELECTION:**

  -In the "about us" page, the rolling list on the bottom keeps distracting the user. And the reasons provided in this page need some icon to explain themselves better(1/5)

**REMARK:**

The effect of the colour changing part conflicts. Although some find it interesting and creative, others regard it as a "noise". More tests on this part are needed to find out more about people's reaction to it.

https://itsnotviolent.com/

**REASON FOR SELECTION:**

A creative educational website. Not only contains knowledge but also the entrance to help. Provides a mobile-like experience on a laptop.

**REMARK:**
The usage of memes is worth discussion.

**5. KUA Coffee**
https://kuacoffee.co/

**REASON FOR SELECTION:**

Retelling the heart-warming real-life story brought by the brand. Not a website with fancy animations, but the simple interaction that affects the statistics is persuasive. (Slide the bar of"How many coffees do you have a day?" result in the change on the land you save) Could be regarded as a control group example compared to the rest of the candidates rich in animations.

**6. Adventure Awaits...**
https://www.defeatboco.com/

**REASON FOR SELECTION:**
An educational website theme at UX design. The whole story is a hero story where the user acts as a hero and finally get to success. There are barriers and darkness in the way. The brand guide the user walking through the whole experience. (Good example of story branding) The story uses a strong metaphor of describing the conflicting opinions as "beasts" that the customer has to fight with.

**ADVANTAGE:**

- easy to scroll back and forth if some messages are missing （3/5）
- The slight gamification light up the whole game. "The final short test after each scene helps the user to understand the content better. And it is considerate that even if you choose the wrong answer, you do not have to start from the beginning, just keep making choice until you get it right. No pressure. The life bar above the monster head making the process more like a game".（3/5）
- Large font size is considerate (2/5)
- the metaphor of describing conflicts as monsters are quite clever（2/5）
- easy to jump between scenes thanks to the navigation bar （2/5）
- the mixture of vertical and horizontal movement make the adventure whole and realistic.(2/5)
- Instruction in the front page is clear (1/5)
- The free pdf appears at the beginning of the first story greatly attracts user（1/5）
- The call to action link is spreading all over the whole experience (1/5)

**DISADVANTAGE:**

- No patient to scroll all the way to last (3/5)
- Animations are not strongly linked to descriptions(2/5)
- Someplace seems clickable but actually not (2/5)
- "The website adventure style is better for a travel agency."(1/5)
- Scrolling too fast will miss some interaction, better slow down a bit when it comes to interactions(1/5)
- "Sometimes might miss some point in the story, which cause a bit of difficulty in answering questions. Will be better if there are some highlight of knowledge point during the experience"(1/5)
- The sound effect is not loud enough that it almost gets ignored (1/5)
- Description fonts are too small to read (2/5)

**REMARK:**
How often should a call to action message appear? It has to appear for certain times so that customer will not miss the message. But not too frequent enough to be annoying.

The visual design of the hints should not cause too many misunderstanding. For example, a button better look like a button so the user knows he can click it.

Sometimes the settings of user's device might not be ideal. In this case, some complain the sound of the website is not loud enough - the developer should test everything before publish and make sure the default settings are suitable for most of the customers.

**7. Zenly**
https://zen.ly/

**REASON FOR SELECTION:**
A product propaganda page with well-designed 3D environments.Overall still a scrolling experience, with several extra clicks involved. Specifically, the website uses sound effect and continuous hover effect to help to build a cheerful brand image.

- The stories are connected and based on real social scenarios, like interacting with friends (3/5)
- BGM and sound effect make the environment immersive (2/5)
- Nice bubbly interactions (2/5)
- Call to action is clear (2/5)

**DISADVANTAGE:**

- Worry about the safety of privacy (3/5)
- Don't know what to do at the beginning, need some guide that tells me to scroll (2/5)
- Colour is not well-picked (1/5)
- Download message is annoying (1/5)
- Some paragraphs are not recognizable from the background (1/5)

**REMARK:**
When there is a huge question mark in the consumer's head - in this case, about the private security, provide the solution in page and make it easy to be seen. At the end of scrolling the story, there is a link says "Zenly is good for you" with the security guarantee inside. But the slogan did not make its goal crystal clear. Directly says "Zenly is safe for you, want to know why?" might be a better choice.

The judge on colour is rather subjective and change according to the personal emotion of users. Therefore a scientific colour scheme that expresses the right brand emotion is necessary.

**8. The Bottle Is The Message**

**10. Build Securely**
https://safe.page/buildsecurely/

**REASON FOR SELECTION:**

- Add captions to the video embedded (1/5)

#### Comparison

**Scrolling story-telling experience | [Cytora] vs [Build Securely]**

Both websites build up an animated story based on hypothetical characters and their goals are selling their services. Although the illustration and animations are all gorgeous, they all fail to actually interact with the audience. There is no fault with the scroll-trigger-animation setting, but user is not actually changing the direction of the story or even step into the story (e.g. slide and help launch the rocket). Overall the experience is more like reading an e-book on a website or watching a video that could be controlled frame by frame, which is not as immersive as a slightly gamified experience.

While the former describes the whole decision-making process to help the user understand the usage of AI in commercial underwriting, the latter compare two characters with and without using Google domain service to stress the importance of keeping the website safe. They all help the user step into the shoes of a related character and follow the process through their eyes.

**Gamified educational experience | [SOS Violence Conjugale] vs [WWF Finprint]**

**Good marketing with statistics and real-life story provided|[KUA coffee] vs [Dopper]**
_TBC_

#### CONCLUSION

Here are the takeaways of the 10 websites under surveyed:

**UX**

1. An adequate amount of gamification like multiple choice might engage the audience.
2. The length and the number of stories inside a page have to be reasonable. Too less, the user might find the website too boring to browse through. Too much, the user will have no patient going through all of the content.
3. Always give the user the choice to skip unless it is absolutely necessary to stay on a certain page. The user might leave because they cannot immediately jump to the section they want.
4. The performance of a page matters. When a website burns the laptop hard or not interact fluently, the user will get a negative impression.

**UI**

1. The landing page needs clear instruction and a strong slogan.
2. The accessibility of the font should be considered.
3. The style of buttons in the same website should be consistent.
