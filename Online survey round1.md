I conducted a samll range of online survey that involved 12 anonymous Chinese student studying in UK. The aim of this survey is to find out what factors do Chinese student care most about a website that explain its brand well.

Each student got 4 random websites from the 10 webstie list to test. Additionally, 2 students among the 12 were asked to comment on one more website. In the end, every website got 5 feedbacks.

There are 3 questions for each website. Students were asked to note down the advantage and disadvantage of the given websites. Thees first 2 questions are totally open, not limited to UI or Ux area. In this case, I can get a more general idea of peer's taste. The third question is "How likely are you to recommend this website to your friend?" for a more quantifiable result.

Why these 10 websites are selected out of over 200 award winning canidates and the conclusion of testing result of the survey are listed as followed (5 feedbacks on each website, numbers in brackets indicate number of feedback that mentioned similar feature):

3.

**UI**

1. The landing page needs a clear instruction and a strong slogan.
2. The accessibility of the font should be considered.
