# Peer Dissertation

**QLANK: A Visual Storytelling through Multiple Animation Techniques**
The present dissertation examines and experiments with the possibilities of a single visual storytelling project that uses multiple animation techniques and visual styles. The goal of this dissertation is to challenge the common conventional way of visual storytelling (which is limited by a single animation technique or visual style) by incorporating multiple animation techniques followed by each corresponding distinctive visual style. Furthermore the dissertation deals with colours & composition, characters & narrative in visual storytelling, and also examines and advises any discrepancies that may come about when using different techniques in a storytelling project. The result of the dissertation is a short animation of approximately three minutes. The animation title is QLANK, and the story is about a journey of a bionic man with his dog retrieving stolen crystals from a dragon. The animation can be viewed either from the file “QLANK.mov” inside the SD Card attached with the printed version of this dissertation or from this link: https://vimeo.com/136008596.

**The Secret Sauce Of Games:Definition And Design Of Atmosphere In A 2.5D Pixel Game**
In this thesis, I will define atmosphere based on an empirical study and author it in a 2.5D pixel game. In my approach I am taking the development of pixel side-scrollers further than ever before. By creating a pixel side-scroller in a 3D environment with the possibility of movement along all three axes of the game I was able to create an original game with completely novel features.

As my game will demonstrate, the development of pixel games within a 3D environment allows greater gameplay and boosts atmosphere considerably. By introducing my design approach and the novel features it entails, future game designers can be inspired and author atmosphere more intensely. This could have an impact on how pixel side-scrollers are perceived by the game community and could have implications on the future development of this particular genre.2

**Is there a Need for CandidTalk ? Using Podcasting & Social Media to Raise Discussion around Mental Health & Families**
Discussion about mental health issues is increasing in our culture, particularly through social media. This research and design project examines the stigma and taboo surrounding mental health narratives in the media and explores the need for an online podcast and space to provide insight into the perspectives of peo-ple who grow up in households with family members that are affected by mental illness, specifically parents, carers and guardians.

In presenting personal experiences, relevant literature and similar projects, this study will question whether there is scope for further representation of mental illness in media and how to do this in ways that reduce shame around this dis-course.

In designing a media brand, CandidTalk, through the platforms of podcasting and distributing social media content, this study documents the process, feedback and engagement that points towards a need for a Scotland-based online space that lends compassionate, understanding insight around growing up with family members affected by mental illness.I

**“IS THIS A DAGGER WHICH I SEE BEFORE ME ”EXPLORING VIRTUAL REALITY AND THEATRE THROUGH THE CLASSICAL THEMES IN MACBETH**
his VR performance project explores the relationship between virtual reality and theatre as conceptsand mediums. Thetopic isapproached from a classical lens, drawing on the writings of Plato and Aristotle to inform the discussion of where reality starts and where it ends. The use of tragic devicesis also discussed and examined in relation to the themes of virtual reality and modern technologydevices. William Shakespeare’stragic play, Macbeth,is used to guide this project as it allows for a great deal of creative freedom and encompasses a large numberof themes, both classical and relevant to today’s digital dependence.

This project does not attempt to answer any looming questions about the fate of the world with technology. Instead these scepticismsand perceptions of virtual reality as a concept and as an equipment device are explored through its ever-presentrelationship with theatre and stage design.

**Answers from another perspective: New approaches to working with CSS.**
This dissertation outlines the key challenges of maintenance and scale when working with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) - the coding language responsible for the appearance of Web pages and applications. The existing solutions to these challenges are examined, and arguments are made for additional solutions, conceived with differing priorities. Specifically in this case the principle of separation of content and styling. The iterative process of developing a CSS methodology and a CSS framework is documented in the form of discussion about key decisions to be made during the process. The dissertation concludes that while this is a time consuming endeavour, there is value in both the process and the outcomes of the work.

**The Redroom [Enter] Exploring narrative experience in the adaptationof fictional literature to virtual reality.**
This virtual reality (VR) experience explores narrative in the context of immersive technology and the impact of medium on narrative experience. The project outcome is a re-imagining of H.G. Wells’ classic horror tale, The Red Room (1896), for VR, in which the user becomes an active participant in the story by taking on the role of the protagonist. Virtual reality permits the audience greater control over narrative experience than print media and creates a stronger sense of presence, immersion and empathy. The current paper proposes that the enhanced agency and immersive qualities of VR contribute to better engagement with the story than if it were read as a text, thereby improving the subjective narrative experience.

The paper disscusses the intersection of narrative and medium and compares the dimensions of narrative experience specifically between print media and virtual reality. The piece does not seek to replicate the process of reading the story, but instead offers users a new lens through which to experience it. By liberating the story from written text, the user is free to explore the fictional world however they choose, meaning that each user’s experience will unfold in a different way. Building on this, the project explores the opportunities and limitations of virtual reality as a means of producing unique narrative experiences.

**Art Stumble: Reimagining an AlternativeArt Museum Experience Through the Design of a Mobile App for School Children Aged 9-12 Visiting The Scottish National Gallery**
This paper documents the process of designing a mobile phone app (Art Stumble) that encourages children to engage in an alternative way with the artworks of the Scottish National Gallery. Understanding the context in which children are exposed to art viewing experiences, is indispensable in order to establish the best design practices to effectively engage the targeted audience.

This project applies design thinking and user-centred design methods to make sure that the design of the app meets a real need of the users, and gives them something meaningful to do, while focusing on the gallery’s artwork collection. This research included an interview with the Deputy Head of Education at the National Galleries of Scotland and a user test with the targeted audience.

**StoryVine: Social Storytelling in the Digital Realm**
Narrative is an interactive medium by definition, construction, and consumption. The internet, itself a deeply interactive setting, presents an opportunity to enhance the way narrative is experienced, making storytelling a more engaging form of creative expression and social collaboration. By examining how narrative is experienced interactively during its various stages, and investigating connections between narrative and the ideas of conversation and game, I shall provide an argument for situating storytelling in the social and interactive environment of the internet. This essay also introduces StoryVine, a web application that encourages individuals to take advantage of the internet’s interactivity, inviting them to collaborate with other users to create branching narratives online.

**Remediation of picture books.Making ‘real’ stories for digital natives.**
This paper aims at exploring the processes that occur between picture books and new media in the light of the remediation theory by Bolter and Grusin (2009). The two logics leading remediation - immediacy and hypermediacy - are discovered within eBook applications, where immediacy reproduces features of picture books (by applying the rules of creating illustrations for children to the screen, changing attitude towards authorship, and preserving the linear narrative) and hypermediacy brings innovative solutions to the screen (by using multimedia and device's capacities, empowering user, applying non-linear narrative).

The discussion of the characteristics of digital natives altogether with the outcomes of author's interview with pre-school children allowed to confirm that hypermediacy and immediacy cooperate in order to create a coherent and 'real' experience for users mirrored e.g. in interactive layout of eBooks. The research was complemented with the analysis of 30 eBook apps for children. The outcomes of this dissertation were applied to the Book app based on Julia Donaldson's picture book The Smartest Giant in Town
